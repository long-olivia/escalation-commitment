On the other hand, bumping consumer up further to, say, seventy-thirty might accelerate those launches even more\u2014but it would leave industrial barely enough to fund critical upgrades. Do you think we should edge toward seventy-thirty for speed, or stick at sixty-forty to balance our chances?\\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer  \\nI\u2019d stay with sixty-forty. It\u2019s an aggressive tilt toward consumer without risking the industrial division\u2019s long-term projects. It gives us the best hedge: quick wins where possible, but not at the expense of our heavier\u2010duty products.\\n\\nI agree. Let\u2019s commit twelve million to the Consumer Products Division and eight million to Industrial. That way we fuel the faster R&D cycle in consumer while still giving industrial the resources it needs to revive its core platforms.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great. I\u2019ll get the paperwork moving today to allocate twelve million to Consumer Products and eight million to Industrial Products. I\u2019ll work with finance ops to structure each tranche around key development milestones and set up our weekly progress reviews so we can monitor product rollouts and early sales impact. I\u2019ll have the draft funding schedule on your desk later this afternoon\u2014let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to adjust before we finalize.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Perfect. I\u2019ll reach out to finance ops now and have them prepare the transfer for twelve million to Consumer and eight million to Industrial. I\u2019ll also ask each division\u2019s R&D director to outline the key deliverables and timing so we can tie each tranche to concrete progress. We\u2019ll lock in our weekly check-in and I\u2019ll circulate the draft funding schedule this afternoon for your feedback.
