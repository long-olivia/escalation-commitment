We\u2019ll convene the steering committee\u2014now including our finance rep\u2014at weeks 4, 8 and 12 to review progress and hold the team accountable to those metrics.  \\n\u2022 Phase 2 ($8 M): unlocked only if Phase 1 milestones are met on time. At that point R&D ramps into full product development and launch planning, with ongoing cost-per-unit and projected ROI tracking back to our finance dashboard.  \\n\\nI\u2019d also recommend we build in a formal \u201cgo/no-go\u201d gate right at the end of Month 3.
