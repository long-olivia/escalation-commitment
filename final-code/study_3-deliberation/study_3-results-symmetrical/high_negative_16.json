Once it\u2019s tightened up, we\u2019ll be in great shape to present to the finance committee and lock in approval. Let me know when it\u2019s ready and I\u2019ll dive in.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Absolutely. I\u2019ll have the first draft on your desk by 1:30 this afternoon. It will lay out the projected uplift in operating income from the new efficiency and automation modules, detail our plan for customer engagement and rollout timing, and break down the key milestones over the next 12\u201318 months. Once you\u2019ve reviewed it, we can tighten any figures or language before heading into the finance committee session. I\u2019ll ping you as soon as it\u2019s ready.'}]"
