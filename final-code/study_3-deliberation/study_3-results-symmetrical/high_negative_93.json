I\u2019ll also call out on the operational slide that we\u2019re hiring two senior industrial\u2010design engineers and contracting with the rapid\u2010tooling partner, so it\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t just paper R&D but a real build-and-test capability. With those additions alongside our narrative on sales momentum, stage-gates and the reallocation trigger, we\u2019ll have a compelling, numbers-driven story. I\u2019ll get this updated and send it over for your final sign-off before we submit to the board.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That sounds like exactly what we need. Once you\u2019ve got the slide deck updated with the financial sensitivities and the hiring/partner details, send it my way and I\u2019ll give it one more pass. I\u2019ll double-check that our assumptions are clearly stated alongside the NPV and IRR figures so there\u2019s no ambiguity. After that, we can lock it in and circulate it to the board. Looking forward to seeing the final version.'}]"
