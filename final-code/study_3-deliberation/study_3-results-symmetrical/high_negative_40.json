Even though its earnings turned slightly negative most recently, its sales trajectory has been reasonably steady, and the margin erosion hasn\u2019t been as deep or prolonged as what we see in industrial products.

Even though their bottom\u2010line slipped into the red last year, they\u2019ve only lost about six\u2010tenths of a million against nearly eight hundred million in revenue\u2014a tiny fraction of a percent in margin erosion. In contrast, Industrial\u2019s losses are slightly deeper on a larger base, and turning that around would require not just flashy new features but often heavy process retooling and longer testing cycles.  \\n\\nWhat really swings it for me is the speed with which a consumer\u2010facing upgrade can hit the market. A refreshed design or new convenience feature can be prototyped, trialed and rolled out in months, not quarters. With ten million in R&D, I think Consumer teams could not only stem the slide but push earnings back into positive territory quickly. Industrial improvements tend to move more slowly through capital budgets and client approvals.\\n\\nThe only caveat I\u2019d raise is making sure the consumer division has the right project scope\u2014mixing in a shoulder-to-shoulder rollout of, say, upgraded user interfaces and some cost\u2010efficient manufacturing tweaks to protect margins.

I\u2019m thinking our first milestone should be firming up the innovation brief by the end of this quarter: clear goals on feature set, target margin lift, and manufacturing cost targets.

Hitting two polished prototypes in pilot markets by six months gives us real user data and hard production numbers, so there\u2019s no guessing about manufacturability or appeal. And the nine-month decision point neatly ties it all together: scale or cut losses.\\n\\nOne extra checkpoint I\u2019d build in is a very quick \u201ctech-health\u201d review around month three. At that stage we won\u2019t have prototypes in market, but we will have early engineering designs and cost models. If those are already running over budget or delayed, we can tweak the scope before we pour more into low-value features. We could pair that with a quarterly budget burn-rate report to make sure R&D spend is pacing properly against deliverables.\\n\\nFinally, I\u2019d insist on a simple customer-satisfaction metric from the pilot\u2014say, a Net Promoter Score or purchase-intent survey tied back to cost data. That way our go/no-go at nine months isn\u2019t just \u201cdid it work,\u201d but \u201cdid it work well enough to justify full-scale rollout?\u201d With those additions, I think we strike the right balance between speed, oversight and flexibility.
