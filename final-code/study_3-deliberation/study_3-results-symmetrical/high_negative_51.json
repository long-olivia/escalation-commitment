Feel free to tweak any of the numbers or assumptions, but in essence it lays out how we see sales and margins evolving under three scenarios and ties each milestone to a mitigation step.\\n\\nAppendix: Consumer Products R&D Funding Scenarios\\n\\nBase Case  \\nWe assume the $10 M investment yields two new feature releases over 12\u201318 months. In Year 1, sales climb by 4% to $800 M and margin turns slightly positive at 0.5%, producing roughly $4 M in earnings. In Year 2, continued feature roll-outs drive sales to $840 M (8% year-on-year growth) and margin expands to 2%, generating about $17 M in earnings. Primary mitigation for schedule slippage is a mid-project go/no-go gate at month 6\u2014if the first feature isn\u2019t fully functional, we pause and reallocate resources.\\n\\nUpside Case  \\nHere, early prototyping accelerates: sales jump 8% in Year 1 to $830 M and margin reaches 2%, or $16 M in profit. Year 2 sees a further 12% boost to $930 M in sales, margin at 4%, and earnings near $37 M. We expect this if R&D finishes both features ahead of schedule and the market responds strongly. To guard against cost creep, we enforce weekly cost reports tied to each development milestone, with a hard cap on scope changes.\\n\\nDownside Case  \\nIf competitive actions force discounting or features underperform, Year 1 sales rise only 2% to $785 M and margin stays flat or slightly negative (\u20130.5%), producing a small loss of about $4 M. Year 2 sales move to $800 M (1.9% growth), margin improves modestly to 0.5% for roughly $4 M in earnings. Our key mitigation is a go/no-go gate before committing the second $5 M tranche; if competitive intelligence shows a rival launching a superior feature set, we suspend further spend and refocus on cost reduction.\\n\\nWith these scenarios and their controls in place, the board will see both our upside potential and the guardrails designed to keep the project on track.
