A $10 million boost in process\u2010and\u2010materials R&D there might deliver margin gains faster, shoring up profitability sooner.\\n\\nSo I see a trade-off: consumer R&D could unlock a fresh growth curve but carries longer development and launch risk; industrial R&D may be more incremental but has a shorter path to better earnings.
