If you could slide in a quick sensitivity chart showing gross-margin uplift at 1, 2 and 3 percent (and the corresponding EBITDA impact), that\u2019ll help the board see the upside range. Also, it might be worth a single backup slide outlining our Industrial-R&D fallback plan, so they know we\u2019ve got a clear path if tranche two doesn\u2019t get released. Other than that, I\u2019m all set. Let me know when the deck is updated and we\u2019ll go win them over.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'All set\u2014I\u2019ve added the sensitivity analysis showing what a 1, 2 and 3 percent gross-margin bump delivers in EBITDA, and I\u2019ve tacked on a backup slide that outlines our Industrial-R&D fallback plan with timing and expected savings. Give it a look and let me know if you\u2019d like any tweaks before we head into the meeting.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'This looks sharp\u2014thanks for pulling it all together. The sensitivity chart clearly lays out the EBITDA upside at each margin bump, and the fallback slide gives us a solid safety net story. I have just one tiny suggestion: let\u2019s label the y-axis on the sensitivity graph in \u201c$ millions\u201d to make those figures jump off the page. Beyond that, it\u2019s board-room ready. I\u2019m comfortable moving in as is.'}]"
