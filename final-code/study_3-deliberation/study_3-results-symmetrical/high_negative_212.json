What strikes me is that industrial sales momentum has stayed more consistently upward, suggesting a healthier market position where fresh R&D could reignite profits.

How do you see it?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You make a good point about the industrial arm\u2019s steady upward trajectory. If its sales base is still climbing, a fresh R&D infusion could potentially boost margins and turn that small loss back into a healthy profit.

Do they have the internal capabilities\u2014staff, projects in the pipeline, partnerships\u2014to turn that cash into new products or efficiency gains? If they don\u2019t, we might be better off putting the money where it can be spent more quickly, even if that\u2019s the riskier turnaround in consumer.
