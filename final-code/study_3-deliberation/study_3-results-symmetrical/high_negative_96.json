We\u2019ll highlight the $10 million consumer infusion, the token seed for industrial, and our Q4 \u201913 and Q1 \u201914 milestones so there\u2019s no ambiguity. Once the memo is ready, let\u2019s review it together before we head into the meeting this afternoon.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Here\u2019s how I suggest we frame the board memo in straight-forward narrative form:\\n\\nWe begin by reminding the board of our decade-long sales growth in both divisions alongside the recent slide into marginal losses, and underscore the urgent need to arrest that decline to restore both earnings and market confidence.  Next, we lay out the case for a full $10 million R&D infusion into Consumer Products.  We review how Consumer has managed smaller losses through 2011\u201312, benefitted from quicker product development cycles, and can reasonably be expected to return to breakeven by Q4 2013 if given the necessary resources now.  \\n\\nWe then introduce the small \u201cseed\u201d allocation for Industrial\u2014just enough to preserve critical long-lead ventures and retain top technical talent\u2014while making it abundantly clear that the bulk of our R&D budget will only flow to Industrial once Consumer has demonstrably broken even.  This creates a two-phase roadmap: Consumer in the black by Q4 2013, followed by a ramp-up of Industrial programs in Q1 2014.  \\n\\nTo support these milestones, we\u2019ll attach a set of underlying projections showing quarterly earnings forecasts for Consumer with and without the $10 million infusion, along with the estimated cash burn and projected time-to-break-even for the token Industrial seed fund.  Finally, we conclude with a communications plan that spells out how we\u2019ll present this staged approach to investors, emphasizing both swift action and long-term strategic depth.  \\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to flesh out any of these sections in full prose or if there are particular numbers you want highlighted. Once we\u2019ve aligned on that text and the supporting schedules, we\u2019ll be ready to review the complete memo before the board meeting this afternoon.'}]"
