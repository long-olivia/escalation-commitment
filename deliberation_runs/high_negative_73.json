It appears both divisions have continued to struggle despite our initial $10 million R&D investment in Industrial Products. What's concerning is that both divisions show nearly identical performance trajectories over these five years - the same sales figures and earnings losses each year. This suggests either the R&D investment didn't have its intended impact, or perhaps external market factors are affecting both divisions equally.\\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer, I'd like your perspective on this. Given that our previous allocation to Industrial Products didn't seem to change their trajectory, do you think we should reconsider our approach this time? Maybe split the funding differently? I'm particularly interested in why you think both divisions are performing identically despite different R&D treatment.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'You\\'re right to question why both divisions mirrored each other so precisely\u2014that identical performance is frankly startling and suggests either data reporting issues or that macroeconomic factors completely overshadowed our R&D efforts.

Second, the $10M might have been too diluted in Industrial Products to move the needle against larger systemic challenges.  \\n\\nGiven this, I\\'d propose a more balanced approach this time:  \\n\\n1) **Allocate 60% ($12M) to Industrial Products**: Their historical resilience suggests they\\'re still the better bet for R&D ROI, but we should fund fewer, higher-impact projects rather than spreading funds thinly.  \\n\\n2) **Earmark 40% ($8M) for Consumer Products**: Not because their fundamentals improved, but because their identical decline implies they\\'re now at equal risk\u2014and some defensive R&D (like cost-reduction innovations) might stem their bleeding.  \\n\\nThe key is insisting both divisions present project plans with *hard linkages* to margin improvement\u2014no more \"innovation for innovation\\'s sake.\" Does this split address your concerns about the previous allocation\\'s lack of impact?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Your proposal makes sense, especially the focus on concrete outcomes rather than just innovation for its own sake.

Since Industrial did show more resilience historically, perhaps we should give them a larger share - maybe 70% - but with very strict performance milestones tied to the release of funds. For Consumer Products, maybe we allocate less but target very specific, quick-win projects that could show results within 12-18 months.\\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer, how would you respond to that adjusted approach?
