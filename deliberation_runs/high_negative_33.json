While Industrial Products held up better for most of the decade, the fact that their losses in 2011-2012 are now deeper than Consumer Products' suggests their decline might be accelerating.  \\n\\n*gesturing to emphasize the point*  \\n\\nIt makes me wonder if Industrial Products has been relying on past R&D advantages that are finally eroding, whereas Consumer Products has been struggling with margins for so long that their recent losses might actually be stabilizing. If that's the case, injecting R&D into Industrial Products could be more urgent\u2014like reinforcing a dam before it fully breaks.  \\n\\n*pausing to think*  \\n\\nBut here\u2019s the counterpoint: Consumer Products has been in a slow earnings decline for years, meaning their problems might be structural. Even with R&D, turning that around could take longer. Industrial\u2019s sharper drop could be cyclical or tied to a few underperforming products\u2014something R&D might fix faster.  \\n\\n*meeting your gaze*  \\n\\nSo the question is: Do we prioritize the division where R&D could stop a sudden backslide (Industrial) or the one where we might need to rebuild from the ground up (Consumer)?

A strategic R&D infusion could help them leapfrog to next-gen products and reclaim profitability quickly.\\n\\n*raising an eyebrow*\\n\\nWith Consumer Products, we\\'d be trying to fundamentally reinvent their business model after years of margin erosion.

The fact that their top line has kept climbing even as earnings turned negative suggests their core business is still viable; they're just getting squeezed on costs or facing competitive pressures that R&D could directly address.  \\n\\n*pointing at the sales trend lines*  \\n\\nConsumer Products' situation feels more like trying to resuscitate a fading business model. Even with R&D, we'd be betting on creating entirely new demand rather than reinforcing existing strengths.
