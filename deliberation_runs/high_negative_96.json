Rather than dividing based on past performance, perhaps we should allocate based on future potential. Consumer markets often have higher upside from breakthrough innovation, while industrial innovations tend to be more incremental.\\n\\n*stopping abruptly* Wait - here's a radical thought: what if we allocated the entire $20M to whichever division can present the most compelling innovation roadmap?

Despite our $10 million R&D investment in Industrial Products five years ago, both divisions have continued their downward trajectory in lockstep. The identical performance numbers are particularly puzzling - it's almost as if our intervention made no difference at all. \\n\\n*turning to the Assistant Financial Officer* Before we jump to conclusions, I'd like your take on this. How do you interpret these results? And more importantly, what does this suggest about our R&D allocation strategy moving forward? Should we double down on Industrial or reconsider Consumer Products now?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"*leaning forward with a concerned expression* The identical performance is indeed alarming - it suggests systemic issues beyond what R&D alone can fix. But here's what stands out: since our investment failed to move the needle for Industrial Products, perhaps we misdiagnosed the core problem. The parallel declines imply market forces or operational inefficiencies are affecting both divisions equally.\\n\\n*tapping the sales figures* Notice how sales remained flat while losses deepened? This tells me we're dealing with margin compression, not lack of demand. Before allocating more R&D funds, we should ask: are we solving the right problem? Maybe we need process innovation rather than product R&D. \\n\\n*meeting your gaze* That said, if we must allocate this $20M, I'm inclined to split it differently this time - perhaps 60% to Consumer Products, since their sharper historical decline suggests they might benefit more from innovation. But I'm very open to challenging that view. What's your read on these identical trajectories?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"*rubbing temples in frustration* You're absolutely right to question whether we're treating the right disease here. The mirror-image performance is screaming that we're missing something fundamental. Maybe it's rising input costs across the board, or perhaps our entire product portfolio is becoming commoditized. \\n\\n*standing to pace* Your point about margin compression is critical - if both divisions are seeing identical erosion despite different markets, we might need to rethink our approach entirely. Rather than dividing based on past performance, perhaps we should allocate based on future potential. Consumer markets often have higher upside from breakthrough innovation, while industrial innovations tend to be more incremental.\\n\\n*stopping abruptly* Wait - here's a radical thought: what if we allocated the entire $20M to whichever division can present the most compelling innovation roadmap? Rather than predetermining the split, we could make them compete for the funds. How would you feel about that approach?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"*leaning back with raised eyebrows* Now that's an intriguing proposition. A competition for R&D funds would force both divisions to sharpen their innovation theses and might reveal which one truly has the better path to turnaround. It would certainly surface whether either team has been sitting on breakthrough ideas just waiting for proper funding.\\n\\n*thoughtfully* Though I'd suggest one modification - perhaps we allocate a smaller base amount to each (say $5M) to maintain essential R&D operations, then have them compete for the remaining $10M pool based on merit. This way we don't completely starve either pipeline while still creating healthy competition. \\n\\n*leaning forward* The risk, of course, is whether we have the internal capability to properly evaluate these roadmaps. Do you think our review team could objectively assess the proposals, given how emotionally charged this allocation decision has become?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"*standing up decisively* You've convinced me. The competitive allocation approach is the right path forward - it transforms this from a political decision to a merit-based one. Let's structure it exactly as you suggest: $5M base funding to each division to maintain critical R&D, with the remaining $10M awarded based on which team presents the most compelling, commercially viable innovation roadmap.\\n\\n*grabbing a legal pad* We'll need clear evaluation criteria: market potential, technical feasibility, timeline to commercialization, and expected ROI. I'll assemble a cross-functional review team from finance, engineering, and marketing to minimize bias. \\n\\n*firmly* This way, we're not choosing between divisions - we're letting the best ideas win. Unless you have any final reservations, I'm ready to present this approach to the board. They'll appreciate how it aligns funding with accountability.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"*standing to shake your hand* This feels like the breakthrough we needed. Your balanced approach - maintaining baseline R&D while creating competition for the growth funds - is exactly the kind of disciplined innovation strategy we've been missing. The cross-functional review team is particularly inspired; it ensures we're evaluating these proposals through both technical and commercial lenses.\\n\\n*with conviction* Let's move forward with this plan. I'll draft the proposal framework with those four evaluation criteria you outlined, making sure we weight them appropriately based on our strategic priorities. The board should appreciate how this creates accountability while still giving both divisions a fighting chance. \\n\\n*smiling* For the first time in this entire review process, I actually feel optimistic that we might crack this R&D allocation puzzle. Shall we schedule a meeting with the division heads to present this new approach?\"}]"
