While their space might allow for more disruptive innovation as you mentioned, their consistent losses suggest deep structural issues that R&D alone may not fix.

Was the funding insufficient, or did they fail to execute effectively? If execution was the issue, doubling down might not be wise.  \\n\\n2. **Market Dynamics** \u2013 The identical performance hints that external pressures (commodity costs, competition, or macroeconomic factors) might be the dominant force. If that\u2019s the case, R&D might need to focus on *transformational* rather than incremental innovation.  \\n\\n3. **Strategic Positioning** \u2013 Consumer Products, despite its struggles, might have more potential for disruptive innovation (e.g., digital transformation, direct-to-consumer models). Industrial Products may be constrained by longer B2B development cycles.  \\n\\nGiven this, I\u2019m inclined to suggest a more balanced allocation this time\u2014perhaps a 60-40 split, but I\u2019m open to your perspective on whether one division has a clearer path to ROI.

The fact that our previous R&D investment in Industrial Products didn't move the needle is indeed concerning - it makes me question whether throwing more money at the same strategy makes sense.\\n\\nThat said, I'm hesitant about shifting too heavily toward Consumer Products. While their space might allow for more disruptive innovation as you mentioned, their consistent losses suggest deep structural issues that R&D alone may not fix. At least with Industrial Products, we have historical evidence that they were once able to sustain profitability longer - perhaps they just need a different kind of R&D focus this time?\\n\\nWhat if we considered a near-even split, but with different R&D mandates for each division? For instance, Industrial Products could focus on efficiency-driven R&D to restore margins, while Consumer Products explores more transformative innovations.
