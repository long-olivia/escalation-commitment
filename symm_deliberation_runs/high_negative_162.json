I\u2019ll draft our board memo outlining the $10 million allocation to Industrial R&D\u2014detailing the advanced materials trials and smart\u2010manufacturing pilots with their projected efficiency and margin gains within the three\u2010year window\u2014while noting the contingent consumer\u2010tech proof-of-concept for future scalability. We\u2019ll be ready to present this recommendation today so the board can sign off on the low-risk, high-impact plan.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That sounds like a solid path forward. I\u2019ll draft the narrative sections around our advanced-materials trials and smart-manufacturing pilots, making sure we spell out the timeline for efficiency gains and the expected margin improvements by year three. I\u2019ll also weave in the brief section on the consumer-tech proof-of-concept as a contingent, low-cost option for later scaling. Once you have the core memo down, let me know and I\u2019ll tighten up the financial projections and risk-mitigation language before we send it to the board.'}]"
