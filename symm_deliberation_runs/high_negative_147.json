Industrial Products\u2019 sales rose a bit more modestly, from roughly six-hundred-and-seventy to just under eight-hundred million, and its earnings also slipped into a similar kind of loss. The big question is where ten million in extra R&D is likely to generate the biggest turnaround in profitability.
