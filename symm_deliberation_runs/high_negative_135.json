Despite stable sales near $770 million over the past two years, earnings have swung from modest profits into a $0.6 million loss, signaling a structural innovation gap. By targeting both a next-generation feature prototype and cost-reduction process improvements in parallel, we anticipate restoring margins by 10\u201315 percent, reigniting customer demand, and delivering a clear, high-impact financial return.\\n\\nBackground  \\nOver the decade to 2012, Consumer Products sales have grown gradually from $624 million to $769 million, yet earnings have eroded from $14 million to a loss. This divergence suggests that the division lacks new high-margin offerings and has yet to modernize its production processes. Addressing both ends of the margin equation through focused R&D is the most direct way to reverse the decline.\\n\\nProposal  \\nWe recommend splitting the $10 million into two milestone-tied tranches. The first tranche will support development of a working prototype delivering a 15 percent improvement in key performance metrics alongside an engineering plan demonstrating a path to at least a 10 percent unit-cost reduction. Upon achieving those targets, we will release the second tranche to execute a pilot production run, validate the cost savings on a small batch, and complete user or field tests of the new product. To keep each effort on track, we will hold bi-weekly progress reviews and reserve a $250,000 contingency for each stream to cover minor overruns.\\n\\nTimeline and Oversight  \\nWe plan to complete the first tranche milestones within six months and the pilot validation within the following four months. Regular check-ins will ensure early warning of any drift, and the contingency pool will allow us to maintain momentum without compromising quality.\\n\\nExpected Impact  \\nWith disciplined, milestone-driven funding and oversight, we expect Consumer Products to recover 10\u201315 percent of lost margin on approximately $770 million of sales. That improvement translates to roughly $77 million to $115 million of incremental operating profit over the next year. Against our $10 million investment, this yields an estimated 8\u00d7 to 11.5\u00d7 return\u2014well above our typical hurdle rate\u2014and positions the division to return to positive earnings, sharpen our competitive edge, and drive shareholder value.\\n\\nI think this nails the key points and seals the financial case. Let me know if you\u2019d like any final edits.'}]"
