And once we green-light the seven-million tranche, we should have a mid-pilot review around month seven\u2014not just at month nine\u2014to verify our process yields the expected quality and costs before scaling up. Other than that, your timeline nails it. If you\u2019ll send over the draft charter with those two brief tweaks, I\u2019ll sign off today and we can lock in our kick-off meeting for Monday.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\u2019ll fold those two tweaks right into the charter. In the first three-month concept phase, along with the focus groups and cost models, we\u2019ll schedule a standing bi-weekly sync between R&D, cost engineering and IP so any design or patent snags surface immediately. Then, once the full seven-million tranche is approved, our pilot run timeline will include not only the month-nine wrap-up review but an interim checkpoint at month seven to validate that quality and cost targets are on track before we scale. I\u2019ll update the draft with those changes and circulate it by close of day. That way you can sign off and we\u2019ll lock in our kick-off meeting for Monday. Let me know if anything else pops up, otherwise we\u2019ll move straight into execution.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That all sounds great. I\u2019ll look out for your updated charter this afternoon and, assuming everything\u2019s in place, I\u2019ll sign off immediately so we can lock in our Monday kick-off. In the meantime I\u2019ll also draft a calendar invitation for our first bi-weekly sync and get our manufacturing, sourcing, IP and sales leads on the invite list. Once the charter\u2019s approved, we\u2019ll be off and running. Thanks for pulling this together so quickly\u2014excited to get started.'}]"
