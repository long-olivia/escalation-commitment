It probably makes sense to convene a kickoff meeting early next week\u2014say Tuesday morning\u2014so we can walk everyone through the charter, confirm roles, and align on deliverables. I\u2019ll draft that invite to include engineering, marketing, supply-chain and any other key partners. Let me know if that timing works, and I\u2019ll look out for your detailed plan.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Tuesday morning works perfectly. I\u2019ll finalize the detailed timeline and responsibility matrix today and have it on your desk by this afternoon so you can lock in the gate dates and budget codes. Once that\u2019s in place, we\u2019ll be all set for our Tuesday kickoff. Let me know if there\u2019s anything else you need before then.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great\u2014thanks for pulling that together so quickly. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for your timeline and responsibility matrix this afternoon. Once I have that, I\u2019ll set up the budget codes, lock in the gate dates on the calendar, and send the Tuesday-morning kickoff invite with a draft agenda and list of attendees. In the meantime, I\u2019ll reach out to our prototype vendors and IT to make sure they\u2019re standing by, and I\u2019ll prep a brief on our go/no-go criteria and scoring process so everyone\u2019s on the same page from day one. If anything else comes up before the meeting, just let me know\u2014otherwise, I\u2019ll see you Tuesday.'}]"
