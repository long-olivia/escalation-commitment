By funding three targeted initiatives\u2014next-generation hardware, enhanced software features, and a pilot in a higher-growth segment\u2014and tying each tranche to six-month go/no-go gates with clear revenue and user-satisfaction thresholds, we ensure disciplined spending and early validation. Success in any stream triggers rapid scale-up; failure across all streams prompts reallocation to the Industrial division\u2019s steadier programs. This stage-gate structure balances the opportunity for a breakthrough turnaround with safeguards against unchecked investment.\"}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Your summary captures exactly what we discussed\u2014and it aligns our bold ambition with the discipline the board will demand. Directing the full ten-million into Consumer R&D, split across those three initiatives and governed by the six-month gates and hard stop criteria, gives us the best shot at a true turnaround while limiting downside. I\u2019ll incorporate your text into our board memo and flag the specific revenue and satisfaction thresholds so there\u2019s no ambiguity. Once we have their sign-off, the Consumer team can kick off prototypes immediately under this stage-gate framework. Are you comfortable with me circulating this proposal to the directors today?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Absolutely\u2014I\u2019m fully comfortable moving this to the board today. The proposal\u2019s structure and metrics give us the rigor they\u2019ll want, and it puts the Consumer team in the best position to deliver a breakthrough. Go ahead and circulate it, and let me know if there\u2019s any additional detail they request.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great. I\u2019ll finalize the memo with our rationale, the three workstreams, the six-month review points and the hard stop metrics, then send it to the board this afternoon. I\u2019ll follow up as soon as I hear any questions or requests for more detail. Thanks for the swift collaboration\u2014here\u2019s to getting Consumer R&D back on track.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\u2019m glad we aligned so quickly. Please keep me posted on any feedback or questions from the board, and I\u2019ll be ready to provide whatever additional detail or analysis they need. Looking forward to seeing Consumer R&D regain momentum.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Will do. I\u2019ll send the finalized memo to the board this afternoon and flag you as our point person for any follow-ups. As soon as they come back with questions or requests for detail\u2014whether on the revenue thresholds, P&L forecasts, or pilot design\u2014I\u2019ll let you know immediately so we can provide the needed analysis. Thanks again\u2014looking forward to getting this launched.'}]"
