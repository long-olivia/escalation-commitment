The initial $6 million jumpstarts scoped prototypes with defined financial targets and delivers an early revenue uplift, while tranche two is tied to on-time prototypes, a 20 % IRR hurdle and cross-functional sign-off to ensure commercial viability before releasing the remaining $4 million. This disciplined approach balances speed and accountability, maximizes upside potential, and mitigates execution risk.\"}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That framework feels solid. By tying the full ten million to both technical milestones and a real\u2010world IRR target, we\u2019re forcing the Consumer team to marry engineering with commercial rigor. I\u2019m comfortable with the six-and-four split, provided we lock in that month-six prototype delivery, the updated financial case hitting at least a 20 percent return, and the cross-functional sign-off in month seven. \\n\\nThe next step is to get the Consumer leadership\u2019s buy-in today, document those gates in a brief term-sheet, and schedule a check-in at each milestone. We should also ask for a monthly dashboard of progress\u2014resource burn rate, prototype status, variant testing results\u2014so we don\u2019t get blind-sided. \\n\\nShall we draft that summary and present it to them this afternoon? If they agree, we can wire over the first six million immediately and kick off the sprint.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Absolutely\u2014let\u2019s put together a concise term sheet this morning. We\u2019ll spell out the six-and-four funding split, the month-six prototype delivery, the 20 percent IRR hurdle, and the month-seven cross-functional sign-off. We\u2019ll also build in the monthly dashboard requirements for burn-rate tracking and prototype progress. Once we have that draft, we can review it together, then sit down with Consumer leadership this afternoon to secure their buy-in. I\u2019ll start pulling the key points into a one-page summary right away\u2014sound good?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sounds like a plan. I\u2019ll pull together that one-page draft right now. We\u2019ll open by stating the total ten-million allocation, then spell out the two-stage funding: six million on day one for sprint projects and four million contingent on hitting our gates. We\u2019ll clarify the three tranche-two gates\u2014a working prototype by month six, an updated business case showing at least 20 percent IRR, and joint sign-off from marketing, manufacturing, and supply chain by month seven. Finally, we\u2019ll note the monthly dashboard requirement covering spend versus budget, prototype milestones and any red-flags. \\n\\nIf you can review it with me by 11 a.m., we can meet Consumer leadership at 1 p.m. today and get their commitment. How does that timeline look on your end?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'That schedule works perfectly. I\u2019ll drop everything to review your one-page term sheet and get it back to you by 11 a.m. With your draft in hand, we\u2019ll be sharp for our 1 p.m. session with Consumer leadership. Let\u2019s reconvene at 11, tighten any loose ends, and then lock in their commitment this afternoon.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great. I\u2019ll refine the draft term sheet right away, weaving in the six-plus-four split, the month-six prototype milestone, the 20 percent IRR requirement, the month-seven cross-functional sign-off and the monthly dashboard for spend and progress. I\u2019ll have it on your desk well before 11 so we can polish any wording and make sure nothing\u2019s missing. Then we\u2019ll be ready to present a crisp one-pager at 1 p.m. to Consumer leadership and secure their agreement. Talk to you at 11.'}]"
