Looking forward to getting this in front of the board and turning things around.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great, that\u2019s our plan. I\u2019ll begin drafting the slide deck today, integrating your cost-of-goods savings analysis and the updated 2013 earnings forecast. I\u2019ll also pull together the detailed validation milestones for the metallurgy and sealing improvements so the directors can clearly see how and when the savings flow through. Let\u2019s aim to have a draft ready by Monday afternoon, which gives us time to refine it before our internal walkthrough mid-week.  \\n\\nMeanwhile I\u2019ll work with finance to update the consolidated projections and set up the monthly check-ins with the Consumer R&D team. That way, if their pilots hit the June milestones, we can move immediately on a second tranche early next year. I\u2019ll send calendar invites for our internal review and for the consumer checkpoints before day\u2019s end. Looking forward to getting this in front of the board and showing real progress.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Sounds like a perfect roadmap. I\u2019ll wrap up the detailed earnings forecast and margin\u2010savings build for the metallurgy and sealing work, then lock in our internal review and consumer check-in meetings on everyone\u2019s calendars. By Monday afternoon we\u2019ll have a full draft deck to refine, and by next Tuesday we\u2019ll be ready to show the board how we\u2019ll drive that $10\u201315 million turnaround. Looking forward to seeing it all come together.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Exactly. We\u2019re aligned. I\u2019ll integrate your margin\u2010savings model into the deck and final earnings forecast, and have a complete first draft ready by Monday afternoon. I\u2019ll also send out calendar invites for our internal walkthrough mid-week and the monthly consumer R&D check-ins. Then we\u2019ll present a polished plan to the board next Tuesday, showing how this funding drives a $10\u201315 million profit lift by year-end 2013 and positions us to back Consumer\u2019s pilots in 2014. Looking forward to executing this and turning our results around.'}]"
