Directing the entire ten-million toward Consumer Products leverages its consistent sales momentum and tackles the margin squeeze exactly where targeted R&D can deliver the biggest bang.

We\u2019ll present a single\u2010page executive summary that opens with our recommendation to direct the full ten-million to Consumer Products, then walk through the rationale: steady revenue momentum, margin compression and the clear opportunity for R&D to reverse it. We\u2019ll outline the two thrusts\u2014premium smart-home innovation and automation-driven cost reductions\u2014alongside our base, optimistic and conservative scenarios, each showing projected impacts on sales, margins and earnings. Below that we\u2019ll insert a concise table breaking out pure product R&D versus go-to-market and support spending so the directors see exactly where every dollar is allocated. Finally, we\u2019ll close with a clear request for their approval and an expected timeline for deliverables and payoff. I\u2019ll draft that memo now and circulate it for your sign-off before sending it up this afternoon.'}]"
