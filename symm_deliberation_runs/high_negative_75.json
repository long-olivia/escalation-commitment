By contrast, Consumer Products revenues have plateaued around $770 million while earnings have deteriorated into deeper losses. We believe that an infusion of R&D funding into Industrial Products will unlock faster and more certain returns, leveraging its existing sales momentum and established customer base.\\n\\nWe propose allocating the full $10 million to a next-generation equipment initiative within the Industrial division. Based on internal projections, a three-point improvement in operating margin on roughly $790 million in annual sales would generate about $24 million in incremental earnings once the new line reaches full production. That equates to over a 100 percent IRR in year one of full rollout, more than justifying our initial outlay.\\n\\nTo ensure disciplined execution, we will implement the following milestones: concept validation by Q4 2012, a pilot build in Q1 2013, and a full market launch by late 2013. We will track development spend against margin improvement targets on a monthly basis, with go/no-go checkpoints at each stage to reallocate resources if needed.\\n\\nNext steps include a project kickoff meeting on Wednesday at 9 a.m. with the Industrial R&D lead, sales team and finance analyst to finalize responsibilities, resource requirements and our reporting cadence. I will forward the simple spreadsheet showing the 3-point margin lift and IRR calculation along with this memo.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like any adjustments or additional detail before we distribute to the board this afternoon.
