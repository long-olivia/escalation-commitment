I\u2019ll work with operations right away to schedule the three\u2010stage disbursements, circulate our engineering, beta\u2010test and channel\u2010commitment milestones to the consumer team, and stand up the monthly dashboard reports. I\u2019ll also lock in our quarterly review meetings so we can sign off each gate before releasing the next tranche. With that in place, we\u2019ll have clear visibility on progress and be ready to deploy the remaining funds as soon as each milestone is met. Let\u2019s touch base as soon as the first engineering results come in.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Excellent. I\u2019ll draft the disbursement memo today, share our milestone schedule with the consumer team, and stand up the monthly dashboard and quarterly review invites. Once the smart-appliance engineering data start rolling in, I\u2019ll flag your calendar so we can walk through the results and decide on the next tranche. Looking forward to driving this turnaround together.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sounds good. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for your memo and calendar invite. Once the first batch of engineering results arrives, let\u2019s set aside time to review the data and confirm the next funding release. Looking forward to seeing these pilots translate into real sales and margin improvements.'}]"
