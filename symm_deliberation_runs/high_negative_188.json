On the other hand, the Industrial division\u2019s sales and earnings decline have been more gradual, which might signal deeper structural issues that a ten-million R&D push may not fully cure.  \\n\\nGiven that we have only one shot worth ten million, I\u2019m leaning toward Consumer Products because the drop looks like something fresh innovation could reverse, and the sales base is still there to support a rebound.

If Consumer Products lost nearly $1 million in the last two years on essentially flat sales, it may be suffering from fixed\u2010cost drag or competitive pricing pressure\u2014things R&D alone can\u2019t always fix.  \\n\\nBy contrast, Industrials has slid more gently.

If R&D could deliver a breakthrough product or cost-efficient manufacturing technique, the upside might be huge\u2014even if the odds are riskier.
