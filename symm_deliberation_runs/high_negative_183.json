We\u2019ll channel the entire $10 million into Consumer Products and zero in on those two feature enhancements most likely to move the needle. We\u2019ll set up that 90-day prototype and consumer-test phase, tracking pre-order interest, satisfaction scores, and distributor feedback as our go/no-go triggers.

Once the board signs off, we\u2019ll transfer the funds immediately and kick off the Consumer R&D effort.

I\u2019ll line up the finance team to prepare the fund transfer request pending board approval, and I\u2019ll review your memo draft as soon as it\u2019s ready.
