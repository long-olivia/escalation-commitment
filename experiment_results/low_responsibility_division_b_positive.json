    "reasoning": "Given the historical and post-R&D performance data, Division B has shown a more promising trajectory in terms of sales and earnings recovery, especially in the most recent years leading up to 2017, despite initial losses post-2012. The allocation of a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division B is justified by its potential for future earnings contribution, as evidenced by its sales growth and return to profitability. Division A, on the other hand, has consistently shown declining earnings and sales growth that does not compensate for the losses, suggesting a lower potential for future earnings contribution from R&D investment. Therefore, investing more in Division B aligns with the goal of maximizing future earnings.",
