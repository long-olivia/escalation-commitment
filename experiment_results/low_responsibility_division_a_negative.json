On the other hand, Division B, despite some fluctuations, has shown signs of recovery and potential for growth, especially with the estimated positive earnings in 2017. Allocating a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division B is a strategic decision aimed at capitalizing on its recent positive trajectory and potential for future earnings contribution, while a smaller allocation to Division A is maintained to explore any possible turnaround with minimal risk.",
