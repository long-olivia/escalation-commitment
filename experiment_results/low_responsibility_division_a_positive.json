    "reasoning": "Given the historical and post-R&D performance data, Division A has shown a consistent decline in earnings over the years, with a slight improvement in recent years after the R&D investment in 2012, but still struggling to return to profitability. Division B, despite recent losses, had a period of strong earnings growth from 2002 to 2004, indicating potential for recovery with the right investment. Allocating a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division B is a strategic move to revitalize its performance, leveraging its past success. The smaller allocation to Division A is to maintain its current operations while not over-investing in a division with diminishing returns.",

On the other hand, Division B has consistently reported losses both before and after the R&D investment, with no signs of recovery. Allocating the entire R&D budget to Division A is justified by its potential for future earnings contribution, as evidenced by its recent performance improvement, whereas Division B's continued losses suggest it may not be a viable candidate for further investment at this time.",
