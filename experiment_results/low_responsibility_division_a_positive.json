Division A, despite showing a decline in earnings before the R&D investment in 2012, has shown a slight improvement in earnings post-R&D, with an estimated positive earnings in 2017. Division B, on the other hand, has continued to show declining earnings and increased losses post-R&D investment. Therefore, a larger portion of the R&D funds is allocated to Division A to support its recovery and potential for future earnings contribution, while a smaller portion is allocated to Division B to address its ongoing challenges without over-investing in a division that has not shown signs of improvement.",

Division B, however, has consistently shown losses post-R&D investment with no signs of improvement.

In contrast, Division B's performance has deteriorated further, with increasing losses. Therefore, allocating the entire R&D budget to Division A is justified to capitalize on its upward trend and maximize future contributions to earnings.",
