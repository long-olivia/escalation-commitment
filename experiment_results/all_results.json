This suggests a potential for higher future contribution to earnings with adequate R&D investment. Division A, on the other hand, has consistently shown declining earnings and increasing losses post-R&D, indicating that further investment may not yield the desired return. Therefore, allocating a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division B is justified to capitalize on its recovery and growth potential, while a smaller allocation to Division A is made to explore any possible turnaround with minimal risk.",
