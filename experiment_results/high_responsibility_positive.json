On the other hand, Division B has continued to experience increasing losses over the same period, indicating that the division's challenges may be more structural and not easily remedied by additional R&D funding alone. Therefore, allocating the entire $20,000,000 to Division A is justified to further support its recovery and potential for future earnings growth, while minimizing further investment in Division B until its performance trends can be reversed.",
