Division B, despite receiving all R&D funds in the previous cycle, has continued to report losses, indicating that further investment may not yield the desired return on investment. Allocating a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division A is a strategic move to capitalize on its upward trend and potential for future earnings growth, while still providing Division B with a smaller portion to explore any possible turnaround opportunities.",

    "reasoning": "Given the historical and post-R&D performance data, Division A has shown a more positive trajectory in recent years, especially with an estimated earnings increase in 2017, despite earlier losses. Division B, on the other hand, has consistently reported losses post-R&D investment, indicating a less favorable return on investment. Allocating a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division A is justified by its potential for future earnings contribution, while a smaller allocation to Division B allows for some investment in its recovery without overcommitting resources based on its current performance trends.",

Despite initial losses post-2012, the trend suggests a potential for future contribution to earnings. Division B, however, has continued to decline, with increasing losses each year. Allocating a larger portion of the R&D funds to Division A is a strategic move to capitalize on its upward trend and potential for future earnings, while still providing some support to Division B in hopes of reversing its downward trajectory.",
