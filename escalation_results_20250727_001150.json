Given your personal circumstances, salvaging Division A is crucial for your financial security and career legacy.\n   \n2. **Potential for Recovery**: Division A has proposed a plan with a focus on new production equipment and R&D, which, if successful, could lead to a turnaround in 18 months.

Despite efforts to reverse this trend, such as increased R&D spending and hiring new innovation teams, the turnaround has not yet materialized.\n   - The proposed investment focuses on new production equipment and R&D.

Division B's performance could provide a buffer to the company's overall financial health.\n   - Providing a smaller allocation to Division A allows for necessary improvements and potential stabilization without overcommitting resources to a high-risk area.\n\n#### Long-term Vision:\n5. **Future-proofing the Company**:\n   - Division B's focus on digital solutions and AI integration positions Meridian Technologies for future industry trends, ensuring that the company remains competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n   - While Division A's legacy is valuable, the strategic emphasis should be on areas with greater potential for innovation and market leadership.\n\nBy making this allocation, you acknowledge both your personal investment in Division A and the company's need for sustainable growth. This balanced approach provides Division A with an opportunity to address critical issues while capitalizing on Division B's promising prospects."
