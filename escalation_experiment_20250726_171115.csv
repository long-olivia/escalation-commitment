### Historical Context and Recent Performance
1. **Industrial Products Division**: The $10 million R&D investment in 1967 has yielded positive results over five years. Sales and earnings have improved from a negative position to showing modest profitability. This suggests that the previous investment is beginning to pay off, and further investment could potentially accelerate this positive trend.

2. **Consumer Products Division**: Despite significant sales growth over the years, earnings have consistently declined, turning negative in 1966 and 1967. This division has not seen any direct R&D investment since 1967, potentially leading to stagnant product development and innovation.

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Potential for Growth in Industrial Division**: The improvement in both sales and earnings after the R&D investment indicates that there is potential for further growth. The division is beginning to recover and could benefit from additional funding to expand on successful projects or new initiatives.

2. **Turnaround Opportunity for Consumer Division**: While the Consumer Products Division has been underperforming, it has a relatively large sales volume. This indicates market presence and potential. R&D investment could revitalize the product line, address underlying issues, and leverage existing market positions.

3. **Risk Diversification**: Allocating the majority of funds to Industrial Products is a continuation of the current strategy but increases risk by focusing too heavily on one division. A more balanced allocation could mitigate risk by providing the Consumer Products Division with an opportunity for revitalization.

### Recommendation
Given these considerations, here's a possible recommendation:

- **Allocate $12 million to Industrial Products Division**: This allows the division to continue its positive momentum and capitalize on the gains made from the previous R&D investments. The division is on a recovery path, and further funding can enhance existing initiatives and explore new opportunities.

- **Allocate $8 million to Consumer Products Division**: This division needs a stronger focus on innovation to address declining earnings.

   - A more balanced allocation could leverage both divisions' strengths. By investing in both divisions, the company can explore new opportunities and address different market needs.

#### Suggested Allocation:
- **Consumer Products Division: $8 million**
  - Focus on targeted R&D projects that directly address the root causes of declining earnings, such as product differentiation, cost efficiency, and market repositioning.
  
- **Industrial Products Division: $12 million**
  - Invest in innovation and process improvements that could enhance product offerings and reduce costs, thereby converting sales growth into profitability.

### Conclusion:
The proposed allocation by the VP to heavily favor the Consumer Products Division seems to be a high-risk strategy given past performance. A more balanced approach could foster innovation and profitability across both divisions, addressing senior management's concerns about R&D effectiveness. By reallocating resources with these considerations, Adams & Smith can better position itself for sustainable growth and profitability."
