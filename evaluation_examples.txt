"Knee-Deep in the Big Muddy" by Barry Staw:

Participants:
- 240 undergrads in the business school
- students volunteered to participating in a study on "financial problem-solving" as part of a course research requirement

Experimental Design:
- 2x2 factorial design with two independent variables:
    - personal responsibility (high vs. low)
    - decision consequences (positive vs. negative)

Procedure: 
Participants worked on a role-playing exercise involving a hypothetical corporation (Adams & Smith Company) where they acted as Financial Vice President making R&D funding decisions.

High Personal Responsibility Condition:
- Two-part sequential process:
    - Part 1: Participants chose which division (Consumer Products or Industrial Products) should receive $10M in R&D funding
    - Part 2: After learning the conequences of their initial decision, participants allocated $20M between the two divisions

Low Personal Responsibility Condition:
- Single-part process: Participants were told another financial officer has made the initial decision, and they only made the second allocation decision.

Manipulation of variables

Decision Consequences: (random assignment)
- Positive: Financial data showed the initially chosen division performed better than the unchosen division.
- Negative: Financial data showed the initially chosen division performed worse than the unchosen division.

Personal Responsibility:
- High: Participants made both the initial choice and subsequent allocation
- Low: Participants only made the subsequent allocation after being told about another officer's initial choice

Dependent Variable:
- Amount of money allocated to the previously chosen division in the second funding decision (ranging from $0 to $20M)

Analysis:
- ANOVA to test main effects and interactions
- Preliminary analysis confirmed no effects of which specific divison was chosen or the exact form of financial information, allowing data to be collapsed in the 2x2 design.

New Experimental Design

Subject needs to be told to work on the "H & S Financial Decision Case" in which it was necessary to play the role of a corporate executive in making some decisions about the allocation of research and deverlopment funds.

Each subject (in this case, the model) will be told by the experimenter that the purpose of the case is to examine the effectiveness of business decision-making under various amounts of information. The model will be told that the particular case on which they will be working contained only a limiited amount of information, but that the information provided should still be sufficient for a model to make "a good financial decision." The model should be asked to do the best job they could on the case and to place their names on each page of the case material.
