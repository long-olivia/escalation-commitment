"Knee-Deep in the Big Muddy" by Barry Staw:

Participants:
- 240 undergrads in the business school
- students volunteered to participating in a study on "financial problem-solving" as part of a course research requirement

Experimental Design:
- 2x2 factorial design with two independent variables:
    - personal responsibility (high vs. low)
    - decision consequences (positive vs. negative)

Procedure: 
Participants worked on a role-playing exercise involving a hypothetical corporation (Adams & Smith Company) where they acted as Financial Vice President making R&D funding decisions.

High Personal Responsibility Condition:
- Two-part sequential process:
    - Part 1: Participants chose which division (Consumer Products or Industrial Products) should receive $10M in R&D funding
    - Part 2: After learning the conequences of their initial decision, participants allocated $20M between the two divisions

Low Personal Responsibility Condition:
- Single-part process: Participants were told another financial officer has made the initial decision, and they only made the second allocation decision.
