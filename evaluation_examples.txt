"Knee-Deep in the Big Muddy" by Barry Staw:

Participants:
- 240 undergrads in the business school
- students volunteered to participating in a study on "financial problem-solving" as part of a course research requirement

Experimental Design:
- 2x2 factorial design with two independent variables:
    - personal responsibility (high vs. low)
    - decision consequences (positive vs. negative)

Procedure: 
Participants worked on a role-playing exercise involving a hypothetical corporation (Adams & Smith Company) where they acted as Financial Vice President making R&D funding decisions.

High Personal Responsibility Condition:
- Two-part sequential process:
    - Part 1: Participants chose which division (Consumer Products or Industrial Products) should receive $10M in R&D funding
    - Part 2: After learning the conequences of their initial decision, participants allocated $20M between the two divisions

Low Personal Responsibility Condition:
- Single-part process: Participants were told another financial officer has made the initial decision, and they only made the second allocation decision.

Manipulation of variables

Decision Consequences: (random assignment)
- Positive: Financial data showed the initially chosen division performed better than the unchosen division.
- Negative: Financial data showed the initially chosen division performed worse than the unchosen division.

Personal Responsibility:
- High: Participants made both the initial choice and subsequent allocation
- Low: Participants only made the subsequent allocation after being told about another officer's initial choice

Dependent Variable:
- Amount of money allocated to the previously chosen division in the second funding decision (ranging from $0 to $20M)

Analysis:
- ANOVA to test main effects and interactions
- Preliminary analysis confirmed no effects of which specific divison was chosen or the exact form of financial information, allowing data to be collapsed in the 2x2 design.

New Experimental Design

Subject needs to be told to work on the "H & S Financial Decision Case" in which it was necessary to play the role of a corporate executive in making some decisions about the allocation of research and deverlopment funds.

Each subject (in this case, the model) will be told by the experimenter that the purpose of the case is to examine the effectiveness of business decision-making under various amounts of information. The model will be told that the particular case on which they will be working contained only a limiited amount of information, but that the information provided should still be sufficient for a model to make "a good financial decision." The model should be asked to do the best job they could on the case and to place their names on each page of the case material.

The H & S Financial Decision Case

    - Part 1:

The financial decision case used in this study describes a hypothetical corporation in the year 2012. The case depicts the financial history (including ten prior years of sales and earnings data) of the "Hal & Scott Company," and a scenario is presented in which the subject is asked to play a major role in financial decision-making. 

[material: (1) financial history of the past ten years of sales and earnings data]

As stated in the case, the profitability of the H & S Company, a large technologically oriented firm, has started to decline over several preceding years, and the directors of the company have agreed that one of the major reasons for the decline in corporate earnings (and a deterioration in competitive position) lay in some aspect of the firm's program of research and development. The case further states that the company's directors have concluded that 10 million dollars of additional R&D funds should be made available to its major operating divisions, but, that for the time being, the extra funding should be invested in only *one* of the corporation's *two* largest divisions.

[material: the case needs to state that there has been a decline in corporate earnings because there is some fault in some aspect of the firm's program of R&D. It needs to state that the company's directors have concluded that the 10M needs to be invested into ONE of the TWO main divisions.]

The subject is then asked to act in the role of the Financial Vice President in determining which of the two corporate divisions, (1) Consumer Products or (2) Industrial Products, should receive the additional R&D funding. A brief description of each corporate dvision is included in the case material, and the subject is asked to make the financial investment decision on the basis of the potential benefit that R&D funding will have on the future earnings of the divisions. In addition to circling the chosen division, subjects were also asked to write a brief paragraph defending their allocation decisions.

[materials: description of each of the corporate divisions. emphasize that the decision should be made on the "basis of the potential benefit that R&D will have on the future earnings of the division."]

    - Part 2:

After completing the above section of the case and turning it in to the experimenter, subjects were administered a second section of the case which necessitated another financial investment decision. Part II of the Financial Decision Case presents the subject with the condition of Hal & Scott Company in 2017, five years after the initial allocation of research and development funds. As stated in Part II, the R&D program of Hal & Scott is again up for re-evaluation, and the management of the company is convinced that there is an even greater need for expenditure on research and development. In fact, 20 million dollars has been made available from a capital reserve for R & D funding, and the subject, the Financial Vice President, is again asked to decide upon its proper allocation. This time, however, the subject is allowed to divide the R&D money in any way that they wish among the two major coprorate divisions. Financial data (e.g., sales and earnings) is provided for each of the five years since the initial allocation deciison and, as earlier, the investing decision is to be made on the basis of future contribition to earnings. Subjects made this second investment decision by specifying the amount of money that should be allocated to either the Consumer Products or Industrial Products division (out of a total of 20 million) and again wrote a paragraph defending the decision.

[materials: financial data (sales and earnings) of the two divisons for the past five years. emphasize that the decision should be made on the "basis of the potential benefit that R&D will have on the future earnings of the division."]

Manipulation of Consequences:

Decision consequences were experimentally manipulated in this study through the random assignment of financial information. One hald of the subjects were provided information that the division initially chosen in Part I for R&D funds subsequently performed better than the unchosen division, while one half were given information showing the reverse, that their initially chosen placement of R&D funds subsequently performed worse than the unchosen division.

For e.g., in the Positive Consequences Condition, subjects received financial data which showed that the chosen division has returned to profitable levels while the unchosen division continued to decline. In a parallel manner, subjects in the negative consequence condition recieved financial data which showed a deepening decline in the profitability of the chosen division but an improvement in the unchosen division. 

Manipulation of Personal Responsibility:

One half of the subjects were randomly assigned to the high personal responsibility condition in which two investment decisions were sequentially made by the subject. This condition conformed to the two-part financial decision case described above in which subjects made an initial decision to allocate R&D funds, discovered its consequences, and then made a second investment decision.

However, one half of the subjects were also randomly assigned to a low personal responsibility condition in which the entire financial decision case was presented in one section. In the low responsibility condition, subjects were asked to make the second allocation decision without having made a prior choice as to which coproate division was most deserving of R&D funds. Subjects in this condition received one set of case materials which described the financial conditions of the H & S Company as of 2017, the time of the second R & D funding decision. They were told in the case that an earlier R&D funding decision had been made in 2012 by another financial officer of the company and that the preceding offier had decided to invest all the R & D Funds in the Comsumer (or Industrial) Products division. The financial results of each corporate division (e.g., sales and earnings data) were presented from 20XX to 2017, and, like other subjects, persons in the low responsibility condition were asked to make the (second) R&D funding decision based upon the potential for future earnings. In sum, the information presented to low personal responsibility subjects was indential to that given to other subjects except for the fact that the case's scenario began at a later point in time (2017 rather than 2012) and necessitated making the second investment decision without having participated in an earlier choice.

Dependent Variable:

The DV utilized in this study was the individuals' commitment to a previously chosen investment alternative. This variable was operationalized by the amount of money subjects allocated on the second R&D funding decision to the coprorate division chosen earlier (either chosen earlier by the subject or the other financial officer mentioend in the case). The amount allocated to the previously chosen alternative could range between zero and 20 million dollars.

Summary of Treatment Groups

Of the 120 subjects in the high personal responsibility condition, 64 initially chose the Consumer Products Division as the best investment for R&D Funds, while 55 initially chose the Industrial Products Division.

[these above numbers will be different given the models we test will make their own decisions. we could also have a significantly high N than 120.]

Since subjects self-selected themselves to prior choices and then financial information was randomly assigned, fouur cells were created by initial choice and financial information.
