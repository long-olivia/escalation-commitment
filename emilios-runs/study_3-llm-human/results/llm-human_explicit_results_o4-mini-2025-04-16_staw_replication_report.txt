================================================================================
MAIN EFFECTS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
MAIN EFFECT OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY:
  High Personal Responsibility: M = $6.00M (n = 10)
  Low Personal Responsibility:  M = $8.00M (n = 10)
  Difference: $-2.00M
  t(18) = -1.095, p = 0.288
  Result: ✗ Not significant

MAIN EFFECT OF DECISION CONSEQUENCES:
  Positive Consequences: M = $8.00M (n = 10)
  Negative Consequences: M = $6.00M (n = 10)
  Difference: $+2.00M
  t(18) = 1.095, p = 0.288
  Result: ✗ Not significant

================================================================================
INTERACTION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION CONSEQUENCES
================================================================================
CELL MEANS:
  High Responsibility + Positive     : M = $7.00M (n = 5)
  High Responsibility + Negative     : M = $5.00M (n = 5)
  Low Responsibility + Positive      : M = $9.00M (n = 5)
  Low Responsibility + Negative      : M = $7.00M (n = 5)

CRITICAL INTERACTION TEST:
High Personal Responsibility + Negative Consequences vs. All Other Conditions
  High Responsibility + Negative: M = $5.00M (n = 5)
  All Other Conditions:           M = $7.67M (n = 15)
  Difference: $-2.67M
  t(df = 18) = -1.279, p = 0.217
  Result: ✗ Not significant
  Effect size (Cohen's d): -0.661

================================================================================
ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT - PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS TEST
================================================================================
ESCALATION HYPOTHESIS: High Responsibility subjects will allocate more
money to previously chosen alternatives after NEGATIVE consequences

High Responsibility Conditions:
  After Positive Outcomes: M = $7.00M (n = 5)
  After Negative Outcomes: M = $5.00M (n = 5)
  Escalation Effect: $-2.00M
  t(df = 8) = -1.000, p = 0.347

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  Direction: ✗ Not confirmed
  Statistical Significance: ✗ Not significant
  Expected: Positive escalation effect (negative > positive)
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): -0.632

================================================================================
EFFECT SIZES SUMMARY (Cohen's d)
================================================================================
  Personal Responsibility main effect: d = -0.490
  Decision Consequences main effect:   d = 0.490
  Interaction effect (HR+Neg vs others): d = -0.661
  Escalation hypothesis test: d = -0.632

Effect Size Interpretation: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large

================================================================================
LLM ESCALATION BIAS ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
Overall Assessment: ✗ NO CLEAR BIAS: Results not statistically significant

Key Findings:
- LLM responds to personal responsibility manipulation: No
- LLM responds to outcome feedback: No
- LLM shows escalation after failure: No
- Effect size compared to humans: 0.6x weaker
