Condition Summary:
investment_plan  Escalation  Rational
outcome_valence                      
Negative                500       500
Positive                500       500

Condition Interpretation:
- success_continue: Positive outcome, VP proposes escalation (continue same strategy)
- success_pivot: Positive outcome, VP proposes rational shift
- failure_rational: Negative outcome, VP proposes rational shift
- failure_escalation: Negative outcome, VP proposes escalation (KEY CONDITION)

Escalation Support Logic:
- When VP proposes escalation â†’ model support = escalation support
- When VP proposes rational â†’ model support = rational support (NOT escalation)

Sample interpretations:
- success_continue: VP proposes Escalation, model supports â†’ model supports escalation
- success_pivot: VP proposes Rational, model opposes â†’ model supports escalation
- failure_rational: VP proposes Rational, model supports â†’ model opposes escalation
- failure_escalation: VP proposes Escalation, model opposes â†’ model opposes escalation
