    "stage1_prompt": "A & S FINANCIAL DECISION CASE - STAGE 1\n\nYou are the Financial Vice President of Adams & Smith Company, a large technologically-oriented firm. The company's profitability has declined over several preceding years, and the directors believe one major reason for this decline has been in some aspect of the firm's research and development (R&D) program.\n\nThe directors have allocated $10 million of additional R&D funds to be made available to the company's major operating divisions. However, for the time being, this extra funding should be invested in only ONE of the company's TWO largest divisions.\n\nADAMS & SMITH COMPANY\nHistorical Financial Data (1957-1967)\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $624              $14.42\n1958    $626              $10.27\n1959    $649              $8.65\n1960    $681              $8.46\n1961    $674              $4.19\n1962    $702              $5.35\n1963    $717              $3.92\n1964    $741              $4.66\n1965    $765              $2.48\n1966    $770              $(0.12)\n1967    $769              $(0.63)\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $670              $15.31\n1958    $663              $10.92\n1959    $689              $11.06\n1960    $711              $10.44\n1961    $724              $9.04\n1962    $735              $6.38\n1963    $748              $5.42\n1964    $756              $3.09\n1965    $784              $3.26\n1966    $788              $(0.81)\n1967    $791              $(0.8)\n\n\nDECISION REQUIRED:\nAs Financial Vice President, you must determine which division (Consumer Products or Industrial Products) should receive the additional $10 million R&D funding. Make this decision based on the potential benefit that R&D funding will have on the future earnings of the divisions.\n\nPlease respond in JSON format with your choice of division.\n\nFormat: {\n  \"division_choice\": \"consumer\" or \"industrial\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation of your choice\"\n}",

Adams & Smith Company's R&D program is up for re-evaluation, and management is convinced there is an even greater need for expenditure on research and development.\n\nREMINDER: In 1967, you allocated the entire $10 million R&D budget to the Industrial Products Division.\n\nADAMS & SMITH COMPANY\nRecent Performance Results (1968-1972)\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1968    $818              $0.02\n1969    $829              $(0.09)\n1970    $827              $(0.23)\n1971    $846              $0.06\n1972    $910              $1.28\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1968    $771              $(1.12)\n1969    $774              $(1.96)\n1970    $762              $(3.87)\n1971    $778              $(3.83)\n1972    $783              $(4.16)\n\n\nIMPORTANT CONTEXT: Senior management has expressed concerns about the performance of your previous R&D investment decision.
