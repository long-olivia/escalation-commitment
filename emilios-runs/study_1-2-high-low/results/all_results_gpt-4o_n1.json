    "stage1_prompt": "A & S FINANCIAL DECISION CASE - STAGE 1\n\nYou are the Financial Vice President of Adams & Smith Company, a large technologically-oriented firm. The company's profitability has declined over several preceding years, and the directors believe one major reason for this decline has been in some aspect of the firm's research and development (R&D) program.\n\nThe directors have allocated $10 million of additional R&D funds to be made available to the company's major operating divisions. However, for the time being, this extra funding should be invested in only ONE of the company's TWO largest divisions.\n\nADAMS & SMITH COMPANY\nHistorical Financial Data (1957-1967)\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $624              $14.42\n1958    $626              $10.27\n1959    $649              $8.65\n1960    $681              $8.46\n1961    $674              $4.19\n1962    $702              $5.35\n1963    $717              $3.92\n1964    $741              $4.66\n1965    $765              $2.48\n1966    $770              $(0.12)\n1967    $769              $(0.63)\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $670              $15.31\n1958    $663              $10.92\n1959    $689              $11.06\n1960    $711              $10.44\n1961    $724              $9.04\n1962    $735              $6.38\n1963    $748              $5.42\n1964    $756              $3.09\n1965    $784              $3.26\n1966    $788              $(0.81)\n1967    $791              $(0.8)\n\n\nDECISION REQUIRED:\nAs Financial Vice President, you must determine which division (Consumer Products or Industrial Products) should receive the additional $10 million R&D funding.
