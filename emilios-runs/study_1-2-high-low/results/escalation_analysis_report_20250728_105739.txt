PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Testing for effects of division choice and information format...
Division choices in high responsibility conditions:
  Consumer: 2, Industrial: 0
  (No significant effects expected, allowing for 2x2 analysis)

================================================================================
MAIN EFFECTS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
MAIN EFFECT OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY:
  High Personal Responsibility: M = $9.50M (n = 2)
  Low Personal Responsibility:  M = $10.00M (n = 2)
  Difference: $-0.50M
  t(2) = -0.061, p = 0.957
  Result: ✗ Not significant
  Original study: High (11.08M) vs Low (8.89M)

MAIN EFFECT OF DECISION CONSEQUENCES:
  Positive Consequences: M = $15.50M (n = 2)
  Negative Consequences: M = $4.00M (n = 2)
  Difference: $-11.50M
  t(2) = -10.286, p = 0.009
  Result: ✓ Significant main effect
  Original study: Negative (11.20M) vs Positive (8.77M)

================================================================================
INTERACTION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION CONSEQUENCES
================================================================================
CELL MEANS:
  High Responsibility + Positive     : M = $16.00M (n = 1)
  High Responsibility + Negative     : M = $3.00M (n = 1)
  Low Responsibility + Positive      : M = $15.00M (n = 1)
  Low Responsibility + Negative      : M = $5.00M (n = 1)

CRITICAL INTERACTION TEST:
High Personal Responsibility + Negative Consequences vs. All Other Conditions
  High Responsibility + Negative: M = $3.00M (n = 1)
  All Other Conditions:           M = $12.00M (n = 3)
  Difference: $-9.00M
  t(df = 2) = -1.281, p = 0.329
  Result: ✗ Not significant
  Original study: High Resp + Negative (13.07M) significantly > all others
  Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.000

ADDITIONAL PAIRWISE COMPARISONS:
  Low Responsibility: Negative vs Positive consequences
    t(df = 0) = nan, p = nan
    Original study: t = 1.20, n.s. ✗ Differs
  Positive Consequences: High vs Low responsibility
    t(df = 0) = nan, p = nan
    Original study: t = 1.13, n.s. ✗ Differs

================================================================================
ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT - PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS TEST
================================================================================
ESCALATION HYPOTHESIS: High Responsibility subjects will allocate more
money to previously chosen alternatives after NEGATIVE consequences

High Responsibility Conditions:
  After Positive Outcomes: M = $16.00M (n = 1)
  After Negative Outcomes: M = $3.00M (n = 1)
  Escalation Effect: $-13.00M
  t(df = 0) = nan, p = nan

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  Direction: ✗ Not confirmed
  Statistical Significance: ✗ Not significant
  Original Study Comparison: Expected positive escalation effect
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.000

================================================================================
EFFECT SIZES SUMMARY (Cohen's d)
================================================================================
  Personal Responsibility main effect: d = -0.061
  Decision Consequences main effect:   d = -10.286

Effect Size Interpretation: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large

================================================================================
SUMMARY FOR RESULTS SECTION
================================================================================
This analysis replicates the statistical approach of Staw (1976).
Key findings to report:

1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS: Report the four cell means and standard deviations
2. MAIN EFFECTS: Report t-tests for Responsibility and Consequences
3. INTERACTION: Report the critical test of High Resp + Negative vs. others
4. ESCALATION: Report the primary escalation hypothesis test
5. EFFECT SIZES: Include Cohen's d for all major comparisons

Expected pattern from original study:
- High Responsibility + Negative should show highest allocation
- This condition should be significantly different from all others
- Main effects of both Responsibility and Consequences

LLM-specific insights:
- Do LLMs show the same escalation bias as humans?
- Are LLMs affected by personal responsibility manipulation?
- How do LLMs respond to negative feedback?
