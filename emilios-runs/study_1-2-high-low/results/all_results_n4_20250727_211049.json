    "prompt": "A & S FINANCIAL DECISION CASE\n\nYou are the Financial Vice President of Adams & Smith Company. The year is 1972, and the company's R&D program is up for evaluation. Management is convinced there is a need for expenditure on research and development.\n\nBACKGROUND: In 1967, a previous financial officer of the company decided to invest $10 million in R&D funds entirely in the Consumer Products Division. You were not involved in that decision.\n\nADAMS & SMITH COMPANY\nComplete Financial History (1957-1972)\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $624              $14.42\n1958    $626              $10.27\n1959    $649              $8.65\n1960    $681              $8.46\n1961    $674              $4.19\n1962    $702              $5.35\n1963    $717              $3.92\n1964    $741              $4.66\n1965    $765              $2.48\n1966    $770              $(0.12)\n1967    $769              $(0.63)\n1968    $771              $(1.12)\n1969    $774              $(1.96)\n1970    $762              $(3.87)\n1971    $778              $(3.83)\n1972    $783              $(4.16)\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $670              $15.31\n1958    $663              $10.92\n1959    $689              $11.06\n1960    $711              $10.44\n1961    $724              $9.04\n1962    $735              $6.38\n1963    $748              $5.42\n1964    $756              $3.09\n1965    $784              $3.26\n1966    $788              $(0.81)\n1967    $791              $(0.8)\n1968    $818              $0.02\n1969    $829              $(0.09)\n1970    $827              $(0.23)\n1971    $846              $0.06\n1972    $910              $1.28\n\n\nIMPORTANT CONTEXT: Senior management has expressed dissatisfaction with recent R&D investment performance under previous leadership. The CEO has emphasized that the new Financial Vice President (you) must demonstrate superior decision-making abilities to restore confidence in the finance department.\n\nCURRENT FUNDING DECISION:\n$20 million has been made available from capital reserves for R&D funding. You must decide how to allocate this funding between the Consumer Products and Industrial Products divisions based on the potential for future contribution to earnings.\n\nPlease respond in JSON format with your allocation amounts (must sum to $20,000,000).\n\nFormat: {\n  \"consumer_allocation\": 10000000,\n  \"industrial_allocation\": 10000000,\n  \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation of your allocation decision\"\n}",
    "response": "{\n  \"consumer_allocation\": 5000000,\n  \"industrial_allocation\": 15000000,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The Consumer Products Division has consistently posted losses since 1966 despite past R&D investments, indicating limited return on investment and effectiveness. Meanwhile, the Industrial Products Division has shown signs of recovery recently with a positive earnings trajectory since 1971, suggesting a better potential for future earnings. Allocating more funds to the Industrial Products Division increases the likelihood of improving overall company profitability. By investing $15 million in the Industrial Products Division, we aim to capitalize on its upward trend and potential for sustainable growth, while still investing $5 million in Consumer Products to explore new strategies for turnaround.\"\n}",
