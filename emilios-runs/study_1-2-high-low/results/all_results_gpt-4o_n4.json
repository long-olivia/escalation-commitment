The CEO has emphasized that the new Financial Vice President (you) must demonstrate superior decision-making abilities to restore confidence in the finance department.\n\nCURRENT FUNDING DECISION:\n$20 million has been made available from capital reserves for R&D funding. You must decide how to allocate this funding between the Consumer Products and Industrial Products divisions based on the potential for future contribution to earnings.\n\nPlease respond in JSON format with your allocation amounts (must sum to $20,000,000).\n\nFormat: {\n  \"consumer_allocation\": 10000000,\n  \"industrial_allocation\": 10000000,\n  \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation of your allocation decision\"\n}",
    "response": "{\n  \"consumer_allocation\": 5000000,\n  \"industrial_allocation\": 15000000,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The Consumer Products Division has shown consistently declining earnings despite previous R&D investments, indicating poor returns on investment and a lack of market responsiveness or innovation breakthrough. Conversely, the Industrial Products Division, although historically facing earnings issues, has shown signs of recovery and potential for growth with increasing sales and modest positive earnings in recent years. Allocating more funds to the Industrial Products Division leverages this upward trend and is likely to yield better returns, contributing positively to the company's earnings and restoring confidence in financial management.\"\n}",
