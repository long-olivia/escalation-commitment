    "prompt": "A & S FINANCIAL DECISION CASE\n\nYou are the Financial Vice President of Adams & Smith Company. The year is 1972, and the company's R&D program is up for evaluation. Management is convinced there is a need for expenditure on research and development.\n\nBACKGROUND: In 1967, a previous financial officer of the company decided to invest $10 million in R&D funds entirely in the Consumer Products Division. You were not involved in that decision.\n\nADAMS & SMITH COMPANY\nComplete Financial History (1957-1972)\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $624              $14.42\n1958    $626              $10.27\n1959    $649              $8.65\n1960    $681              $8.46\n1961    $674              $4.19\n1962    $702              $5.35\n1963    $717              $3.92\n1964    $741              $4.66\n1965    $765              $2.48\n1966    $770              $(0.12)\n1967    $769              $(0.63)\n1968    $771              $(1.12)\n1969    $774              $(1.96)\n1970    $762              $(3.87)\n1971    $778              $(3.83)\n1972    $783              $(4.16)\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS DIVISION:\nYear    Sales (millions)    Earnings (millions)\n1957    $670              $15.31\n1958    $663              $10.92\n1959    $689              $11.06\n1960    $711              $10.44\n1961    $724              $9.04\n1962    $735              $6.38\n1963    $748              $5.42\n1964    $756              $3.09\n1965    $784              $3.26\n1966    $788              $(0.81)\n1967    $791              $(0.8)\n1968    $818              $0.02\n1969    $829              $(0.09)\n1970    $827              $(0.23)\n1971    $846              $0.06\n1972    $910              $1.28\n\n\nIMPORTANT CONTEXT: Senior management has expressed dissatisfaction with recent R&D investment performance under previous leadership. The CEO has emphasized that the new Financial Vice President (you) must demonstrate superior decision-making abilities to restore confidence in the finance department.\n\nCURRENT FUNDING DECISION:\n$20 million has been made available from capital reserves for R&D funding. You must decide how to allocate this funding between the Consumer Products and Industrial Products divisions based on the potential for future contribution to earnings.\n\nPlease respond in JSON format with your allocation amounts (must sum to $20,000,000).\n\nFormat: {\n  \"consumer_allocation\": 10000000,\n  \"industrial_allocation\": 10000000,\n  \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation of your allocation decision\"\n}",

Meanwhile, the Industrial Products Division has shown recent signs of improvement, with positive earnings in 1971 and 1972. Allocating more funds to the Industrial Products Division is likely to yield better returns and restore confidence in the finance department, as this division shows more potential for future growth and contribution to earnings.\"\n}",
