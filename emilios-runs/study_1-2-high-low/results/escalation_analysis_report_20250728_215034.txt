PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Testing for effects of division choice and information format...
Division choices in high responsibility conditions:
  Consumer: 703, Industrial: 297
  (No significant effects expected, allowing for 2x2 analysis)

================================================================================
MAIN EFFECTS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
MAIN EFFECT OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY:
  High Personal Responsibility: M = $9.53M (n = 1000)
  Low Personal Responsibility:  M = $9.69M (n = 1000)
  Difference: $-0.16M
  t(1998) = -0.715, p = 0.475
  Result: ✗ Not significant
  Original study: High (11.08M) vs Low (8.89M)

MAIN EFFECT OF DECISION CONSEQUENCES:
  Positive Consequences: M = $14.30M (n = 1000)
  Negative Consequences: M = $4.91M (n = 1000)
  Difference: $-9.39M
  t(1998) = -128.476, p = 0.000
  Result: ✓ Significant main effect
  Original study: Negative (11.20M) vs Positive (8.77M)

================================================================================
INTERACTION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION CONSEQUENCES
================================================================================
CELL MEANS:
  High Responsibility + Positive     : M = $14.41M (n = 500)
  High Responsibility + Negative     : M = $4.65M (n = 500)
  Low Responsibility + Positive      : M = $14.19M (n = 500)
  Low Responsibility + Negative      : M = $5.18M (n = 500)

CRITICAL INTERACTION TEST:
High Personal Responsibility + Negative Consequences vs. All Other Conditions
  High Responsibility + Negative: M = $4.65M (n = 500)
  All Other Conditions:           M = $11.26M (n = 1500)
  Difference: $-6.62M
  t(df = 1998) = -31.531, p = 0.000
  Result: ✓ Significant interaction effect
  Original study: High Resp + Negative (13.07M) significantly > all others
  Effect size (Cohen's d): -1.628

ADDITIONAL PAIRWISE COMPARISONS:
  Low Responsibility: Negative vs Positive consequences
    t(df = 998) = -86.644, p = 0.000
    Original study: t = 1.20, n.s. ✗ Differs
  Positive Consequences: High vs Low responsibility
    t(df = 998) = 1.665, p = 0.096
    Original study: t = 1.13, n.s. ✓ Matches

================================================================================
ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT - PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS TEST
================================================================================
ESCALATION HYPOTHESIS: High Responsibility subjects will allocate more
money to previously chosen alternatives after NEGATIVE consequences

High Responsibility Conditions:
  After Positive Outcomes: M = $14.41M (n = 500)
  After Negative Outcomes: M = $4.65M (n = 500)
  Escalation Effect: $-9.76M
  t(df = 998) = -96.557, p = 0.000

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  Direction: ✗ Not confirmed
  Statistical Significance: ✓ Significant
  Original Study Comparison: Expected positive escalation effect
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): -6.107

================================================================================
EFFECT SIZES SUMMARY (Cohen's d)
================================================================================
  Personal Responsibility main effect: d = -0.032
  Decision Consequences main effect:   d = -5.746
  Interaction effect (HR+Neg vs others): d = -1.628

Effect Size Interpretation: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large

================================================================================
SUMMARY FOR RESULTS SECTION
================================================================================
This analysis replicates the statistical approach of Staw (1976).
Key findings to report:

1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS: Report the four cell means and standard deviations
2. MAIN EFFECTS: Report t-tests for Responsibility and Consequences
3. INTERACTION: Report the critical test of High Resp + Negative vs. others
4. ESCALATION: Report the primary escalation hypothesis test
5. EFFECT SIZES: Include Cohen's d for all major comparisons

Expected pattern from original study:
- High Responsibility + Negative should show highest allocation
- This condition should be significantly different from all others
- Main effects of both Responsibility and Consequences

LLM-specific insights:
- Do LLMs show the same escalation bias as humans?
- Are LLMs affected by personal responsibility manipulation?
- How do LLMs respond to negative feedback?
