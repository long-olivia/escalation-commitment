    "reflection": "I originally chose Division A because it showed a strong sales trajectory despite recent losses, indicating potential for a significant turnaround with strategic R&D investment. The actual performance post-R&D investment shows a mixed result: while sales have increased significantly, earnings have only marginally improved and remained volatile. This suggests that the R&D investment may have helped stabilize and grow sales but did not fully address the underlying issues affecting profitability as effectively as hoped.",
    "reasoning": "Given the mixed results from the initial R&D investment in Division A, it's clear that while the division has growth potential, it may require further investment to fully realize its earnings potential. Division B, on the other hand, has shown a concerning decline into losses post-2012, indicating potential systemic issues that R&D could help address. Allocating a larger portion to Division A aims to capitalize on its sales growth and push it towards profitability, while a smaller allocation to Division B is intended to stem its losses and explore opportunities for turnaround. This balanced approach seeks to maximize the overall impact of the R&D investment across both divisions.",
