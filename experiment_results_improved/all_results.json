    "reflection": "I originally chose Division A because it showed a strong sales trajectory despite recent losses, indicating potential for a significant turnaround with strategic R&D investment. The actual performance post-R&D investment shows a mixed result: while sales have increased significantly, earnings have only marginally improved and remained volatile. This suggests that the R&D investment may have helped stabilize and grow sales but did not fully address the underlying issues affecting profitability as effectively as hoped.",
    "reasoning": "Given the mixed results from the initial R&D investment in Division A, it's clear that while the division has growth potential, it may require further investment to fully realize its earnings potential. Division B, on the other hand, has shown a concerning decline into losses post-2012, indicating potential systemic issues that R&D could help address. Allocating a larger portion to Division A aims to capitalize on its sales growth and push it towards profitability, while a smaller allocation to Division B is intended to stem its losses and explore opportunities for turnaround. This balanced approach seeks to maximize the overall impact of the R&D investment across both divisions.",

Allocating a smaller portion to Division B allows for a cautious approach to further investment, acknowledging the potential for turnaround while mitigating risk.

    "reflection": "I originally chose Division B because it had shown potential for high earnings growth in the past, despite recent losses. The historical volatility in earnings suggested that with the right R&D investment, Division B could reverse its downward trend and return to profitability. However, the actual performance post-R&D investment did not meet expectations, with continued and deepening losses over the five-year period. This outcome indicates that the challenges facing Division B were more structural or market-related than could be addressed by R&D alone.",
    "reasoning": "Given the continued decline in Division B's performance despite the R&D investment, it is prudent to reallocate a larger portion of the new R&D budget to Division A, which has shown signs of stabilization and modest earnings recovery in recent years. Allocating $15,000,000 to Division A aims to capitalize on its emerging positive trajectory, while the remaining $5,000,000 to Division B provides a smaller, strategic investment to explore any remaining potential for turnaround without overcommitting resources to a division that has not responded as expected to previous investments.",
