At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t abandon the consumer team entirely; we still need fresh product ideas if we\u2019re ever going to turn that business around.  \\n\\nMy sense is to lean the bulk of the new R&D toward industrial efficiency and customization\u2014somewhere in the neighborhood of 60\u201365 percent of the twenty-million\u2014and reserve the remaining 35\u201340 percent for narrowly scoped consumer projects.

Both consumer and industrial have hung in around mid-700s in sales but kept slipping deeper into losses\u2014now roughly four million down in 2017. My gut says we need to ask whether we double down on consumer innovation\u2014hoping we finally hit the right product\u2014or whether it\u2019s time to shift more of this new twenty million toward industrial process improvements or niche custom solutions where margins might recover more predictably. What\u2019s your sense\u2014do we keep backing the consumer side\u2019s big breakthrough play, or pivot toward the industrial division\u2019s steadier, cost-efficiency focus?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'It\u2019s clear that the last ten\u2010million push didn\u2019t move the needle in either division, so I\u2019d resist betting the entire twenty on one side again. The industrial group has shown that it responds more predictably when we fund process improvements and niche upgrades\u2014if we shore up its margins, we\u2019ll likely see a steadier return and limit those multi-million dollar losses. At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t abandon the consumer team entirely; we still need fresh product ideas if we\u2019re ever going to turn that business around.  \\n\\nMy sense is to lean the bulk of the new R&D toward industrial efficiency and customization\u2014somewhere in the neighborhood of 60\u201365 percent of the twenty-million\u2014and reserve the remaining 35\u201340 percent for narrowly scoped consumer projects. That way we shore up the steadier cash generator while keeping enough firepower on tap to chase a genuine consumer breakout. How does that approach sit with you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'That allocation feels like a balanced hedge. I\u2019m wondering though, should we set clear milestones or guardrails tied to each stream? For the industrial side, maybe specific cost-reduction targets or margin improvements, and for the consumer projects some early prototyping success rates or consumer-test benchmarks. Or would that be too rigid and risk slowing innovation? How do you see us structuring those accountability measures so we keep momentum on both fronts?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I think tying each pool of money to a small set of \u201cmust-hit\u201d check-points will actually keep both efforts moving without smothering them in red tape. On the industrial side, for example, we could agree that within six months the team needs to demonstrate at least a 4\u20136 percent reduction in unit-manufacturing cost or a one-point lift in gross margin on a major product line. If they hit it early, great\u2014they get to reinvest any extra savings in a follow-on improvement. If they miss, we pause and reallocate part of that budget to higher-priority fixes.\\n\\nOn the consumer side, I\u2019d build in fast, time-boxed stage-gates rather than open-ended work streams. Something like: deliver three distinct prototypes in eight weeks, run them through a 100-person consumer panel, and achieve an average \u201cpurchase intent\u201d score above our historical 60-percent threshold before we commit to full development. If any concept clears that bar, we funnel more funding toward it; if none do, we either tweak the concepts rapidly or shift resources to the next idea.\\n\\nThose two frameworks give us transparent, quantitative goals but still leave room for the teams to innovate. Monthly reviews against those milestones will show us early whether to double down or pull back, and we\u2019ll avoid the danger of pouring money into a black hole.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\u2019m leaning toward roughly thirteen million for the industrial team and seven million for the consumer side\u2014about a 65/35 split\u2014so the industrial group has the firepower to hit our 4\u20136 percent cost-reduction and margin targets, while the consumer squad still has enough to run two or three rapid prototyping cycles under those stage-gate rules. Does that allocation align with what you\u2019d do, or would you tilt the split differently? Also, do you think we need any built-in reallocation triggers if one team blows past or misses its milestones early?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That split feels right to me. Thirteen million gives the industrial team the headroom they need to chase those 4\u20136 percent cost cuts aggressively, while seven million still funds two full rounds of quick-turn consumer prototypes under our stage-gate rhythm. I wouldn\u2019t tilt it much further\u2014any bigger shift to consumer would weaken the steadier margin recovery in industrial, and any larger tilt to industrial would leave the consumer group starved for options.\\n\\nAs for reallocation triggers, I\u2019d bake in two simple mechanisms. First, on the industrial side: if by the six-month check-in they exceed the 6 percent cost reduction or one-point margin lift, we let them roll over any unspent or \u201cover-achieved\u201d budget into a follow-on project or even shift it to prop up a promising consumer concept. Conversely, if they fall short of a 4 percent cut, we\u2019d harvest up to 20 percent of their remaining pool to redeploy\u2014either boosting the next industrial sprint or seeding an extra consumer trial.\\n\\nOn the consumer side, after each prototyping cycle we\u2019d look at how many concepts clear our purchase-intent bar. If two out of three concepts hit the threshold ahead of schedule, we\u2019d pull a million or two back into the industrial bucket to accelerate margin work. If none clear it, we\u2019d redirect that same amount to fund a fresh set of trials or reallocate directly to industrial. \\n\\nIn practice, these triggers keep both teams honest and let us lean into whichever side is delivering value fastest, without gutting either effort outright. That way, by the time we hit the 12- or 18-month mark we\u2019ll have backed the clear winners rather than sticking to a static split.'}]"
