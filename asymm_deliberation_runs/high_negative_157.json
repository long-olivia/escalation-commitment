Should we consider a slight tilt rather than an exact ten\u2013ten split, or are you comfortable with equal funding as the fairest test?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'When I look at the two roadmaps side by side, the industrial team still has the more mature projects in the pipeline\u2014both the process-automation module and the monitoring system are through final prototype testing and simply need scale-up funding to start generating early revenue and cost savings. Their materials-efficiency initiative should start showing up as margin relief within eight to ten months once pilot tooling is done.  \\n\\nBy contrast, the consumer group\u2019s most promising concepts are still in late-stage development rather than pilot\u2014and they\u2019re targeting a crowded market where shelf space and consumer mindshare take longer to earn. I\u2019d still give them a meaningful funding runway, but I\u2019d bias the allocation toward the industrial side so we capture the faster payback opportunity.  \\n\\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with that trade-off, I\u2019d suggest something like twelve-million to industrial and eight-million to consumer. That tilt both preserves a fair test of the consumer ideas and leans into the clearer, near-term profit drivers on the industrial side. How does that feel to you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'That feels like a thoughtful compromise\u2014leaning into the industrial division\u2019s ready-to-scale projects while still giving the consumer team enough runway to push their late-stage concepts into pilot. With twelve million to industrial, they can wrap up tooling and begin customer rollouts on the automation and monitoring modules, and eight million to consumer should let them finalize at least one promising product test. Does that split sit well with your assessment of each pipeline\u2019s maturity and our need for early wins, or would you tweak the proportions further?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That allocation feels just right. Twelve million to the industrial side gives them exactly the runway they need to finish tooling, kick off small-batch production, and secure initial customer orders on those two proven projects. At the same time, eight million for the consumer division funds a full pilot cycle for their most advanced concept\u2014enough to see real test results in market conditions.  \\n\\nWe keep our tilt toward an earlier payoff but still give the consumer team a fair shot. From here, I\u2019ll work up milestone criteria\u2014for example, tooling completion and revenue-per-unit targets for industrial, and test-market performance metrics for consumer\u2014so we can track progress and decide on any follow-on funding well before the next budgeting cycle.'}]"
