In the first phase, which we anticipate completing in four months, engineering teams will finalize early prototypes for two process-enhancement concepts and one new high-margin specialty product. The second phase, lasting roughly five months, will involve pilot production runs in partnership with the strongest-performing factories, giving us real-world cost and quality data. Finally, in the third phase, we will conduct customer trials over a three-month window, gathering feedback on performance and willingness to pay before committing to full-scale rollout.\\n\\nWe believe this structure keeps execution risks in check. At each gate, we will review technical feasibility, cost-benefit projections and any resource conflicts, reallocating funds or adjusting scope if development cycles run long. By leveraging existing factory relationships and a dedicated cross-functional team, we can anticipate problems early and prevent them from derailing the timetable. Financial modeling indicates that even conservative improvements in yield or price premiums would drive Industrial Products back into positive earnings territory within eighteen months, generating a payback multiple well above our corporate hurdle rate.\\n\\nIf this aligns with your expectations, I\u2019ll finalize the attached exhibits\u2014detailed cash-flow projections, milestone calendar and governance charter\u2014and route the completed package to the board secretary by 10:00 this morning.
