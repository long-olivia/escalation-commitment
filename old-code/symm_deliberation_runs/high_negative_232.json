I\u2019m routing the signed\u2010authority memo to the CEO, CFO, and GC with an express note to return approvals by 5 p.m. today. I\u2019ll shoot you a confirmation the moment it\u2019s signed. The Friday 3 p.m. check-in is on my calendar, and I\u2019ll come prepared with a status update on legal\u2019s template and procurement\u2019s sourcing plan. Thanks for lining up the agenda\u2014I\u2019ll see you then, and we\u2019ll be ready to hit the ground running first thing tomorrow.'}]"
