Channeling the full ten-million into Consumer Products under that stage-gate framework gives us the best shot at regaining positive margins within our 12\u201318-month window. Before we head to the board, I\u2019d simply suggest we prepare a concise one-page summary outlining the key milestones, decision gates and target metrics so they see both the rigor and the speed of our plan. Otherwise, I think we\u2019re ready to recommend locking in funding for the consumer team today.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Here\u2019s a conversational draft of the one-page narrative we can hand to the board:\\n\\nOver the next eighteen months, we\u2019ll move the Consumer Products Division forward in three clear phases. In the first six months, the team will finalize prototypes and complete consumer testing on the top three concepts\u2014our key metric here is achieving a 90-percent prototype completion rate and confirming at least two concepts that exceed our target appeal score. At the six\u2010month gate, we\u2019ll review test results and decide whether to refocus resources or press ahead.\\n\\nFrom month seven through month twelve, we\u2019ll pilot the approved concepts in a select regional market. Our decision gate at month twelve hinges on hitting a minimum pilot sell-through rate of 70 percent and demonstrating unit economics that deliver at least a two-point margin lift. If those targets are met, we\u2019ll greenlight the national rollout.\\n\\nDuring months thirteen to eighteen, we execute the broader launch, tracking overall division profitability against our baseline to confirm we\u2019ve restored a positive margin.
