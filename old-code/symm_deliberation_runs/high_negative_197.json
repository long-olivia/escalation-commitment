Let me know if you\u2019d like me to draft any of the milestone language or pull together the data tables for the board package. I can have a first draft of the charter\u2014and the supporting cost, timeline and competitive benchmarks\u2014on your desk by mid-afternoon. Once you\u2019ve circulated it, I\u2019ll be ready to walk through any questions at tomorrow\u2019s sign-off meeting so we can hit the ground running.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\"contribution\":\"consumer\",\"reasoning\":\"We\u2019re allocating the full $10 million to the Consumer Products Division because its steady topline growth and strong brand equity offer the quickest path to a meaningful earnings turnaround. By enforcing rigorous stage\u2010gates with clear go/no\u2010go criteria, strict cost and reliability targets, and a fast\u2010follower competitive scan, we substantially reduce execution and market risks while capturing margin\u2010enhancing innovation faster than the capital\u2010intensive, slow\u2010burn improvements required in the industrial division.\"}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Got it. I\u2019ll fold that contribution statement and reasoning into our one-page charter and board memo.
