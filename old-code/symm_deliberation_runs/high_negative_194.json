In the memo we can say that in the first month we\u2019ll appoint Dr. Patel as the process-automation lead and Ms. Ramirez for component upgrades. By the end of month two, each team will finish its initial feasibility work and present a go/no-go report. In month three, we expect to have the first operational pilot of the new automation tools running on a selected production line, with parallel bench tests of the upgraded components. Months four and five will focus on scaling those pilots and refining the designs, and by month six we\u2019ll conduct a full-scale margin impact analysis. If by the end of any month we\u2019re more than two weeks behind on a critical milestone, that will automatically trigger a rapid review to decide whether to reassign personnel, adjust the work scope, or bring in additional outside expertise. That way the board can see both our disciplined pacing and our built-in safety net. Let me know if that captures what you had in mind before you slot it into the final draft.'}]"
