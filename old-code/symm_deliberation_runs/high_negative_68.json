Over the past two years, Consumer Products has delivered flat sales at roughly $770 million while slipping into modest operating losses.

These steps provide a buffer against delays and ensure our planned timeline remains intact.  \\n\\nThis plan directly addresses the board\u2019s need for an earnings uptick within four quarters and will supply the conference-call slide deck with tangible evidence of forward momentum.
