I\u2019ll have the full recommendation memo on your desk by 3 pm today. It will open with our decision to allocate the $10 million to the Industrial Products Division, then walk through the pilot structure at the mid\u2010sized plant, our external automation partner agreement to secure this month, and the university lab contract targeted for mid-February.
