Where do you see R&D dollars doing the most to reverse these trends?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\u2019m with you that the consumer division is probably the stronger candidate for a relatively quick turnaround. Its product life-cycles are shorter, and customers are more responsive to new features and design updates. Ten million dollars could fund a couple of accelerated design sprints or prototype runs and, if it lands the next \u201cmust-have\u201d gadget, the boost to volumes and margin could show up in our P&L within a year. \\n\\nBy contrast, the industrial side tends to sell into longer lead-time projects.
