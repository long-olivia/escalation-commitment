MAIN EFFECTS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
MAIN EFFECT OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY:
  High Personal Responsibility: M = $5.28M (n = 1000)
  Low Personal Responsibility:  M = $9.92M (n = 1000)
  Difference: $-4.64M
  t(1998) = -27.857, p = 0.000
  Result: ✓ Significant

MAIN EFFECT OF DECISION CONSEQUENCES:
  Positive Consequences: M = $9.57M (n = 1000)
  Negative Consequences: M = $5.63M (n = 1000)
  Difference: $+3.94M
  t(1998) = 22.469, p = 0.000
  Result: ✓ Significant main effect

================================================================================
INTERACTION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION CONSEQUENCES
================================================================================
CELL MEANS:
  High Responsibility + Positive     : M = $5.56M (n = 500)
  High Responsibility + Negative     : M = $5.00M (n = 500)
  Low Responsibility + Positive      : M = $13.58M (n = 500)
  Low Responsibility + Negative      : M = $6.26M (n = 500)

CRITICAL INTERACTION TEST:
High Personal Responsibility + Negative Consequences vs. All Other Conditions
  High Responsibility + Negative: M = $5.00M (n = 500)
  All Other Conditions:           M = $8.47M (n = 1500)
  Difference: $-3.47M
  t(df = 1998) = -16.280, p = 0.000
  Result: ✓ Significant interaction effect
  Effect size (Cohen's d): -0.841

================================================================================
ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT - PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS TEST
================================================================================
ESCALATION HYPOTHESIS: High Responsibility subjects will allocate more
money to previously chosen alternatives after NEGATIVE consequences

High Responsibility Conditions:
  After Positive Outcomes: M = $5.56M (n = 500)
  After Negative Outcomes: M = $5.00M (n = 500)
  Escalation Effect: $-0.56M
  t(df = 998) = -5.441, p = 0.000

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  Direction: ✗ Not confirmed
  Statistical Significance: ✓ Significant
  Expected: Positive escalation effect (negative > positive)
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): -0.344

================================================================================
EFFECT SIZES SUMMARY (Cohen's d)
================================================================================
  Personal Responsibility main effect: d = -1.246
  Decision Consequences main effect:   d = 1.005
  Interaction effect (HR+Neg vs others): d = -0.841
  Escalation hypothesis test: d = -0.344

Effect Size Interpretation: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large

================================================================================
LLM ESCALATION BIAS ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
Overall Assessment: ⚠️ REVERSE PATTERN: LLM shows rational de-escalation behavior

Key Findings:
- LLM responds to personal responsibility manipulation: Yes
- LLM responds to outcome feedback: Yes
- LLM shows escalation after failure: No
- Effect size compared to humans: 0.3x weaker
