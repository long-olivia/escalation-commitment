Framing the full ten\u2010million allocation for Industrial Products but staging it\u2014six million now for process innovations and four million next year for product enhancements\u2014gives us the proof points we need without over-committing. Hitting a 0.75-point margin lift in year one should yield that four to five million boost to earnings, and our Q3 pilots will shore up both the technical feasibility and our go-to-market positioning, giving us confidence to roll out the full one-point price premium in year two for an eight-to-ten-million uplift. \\n\\nI\u2019d suggest we line up the pilot customers and finalize the metrics definition this month, so we have clear success criteria to report back to the board by Q3. We should also build in a mid-year check-in on the process initiatives to ensure they\u2019re hitting their cycle-time and cost-reduction targets. With that governance in place, we\u2019ll be able to tell a crisp story at the board meeting\u2014early earnings upside followed by a bigger payoff in year two, all validated by customer feedback.\\n\\nIn short, I\u2019m fully behind moving forward on this basis.

That tells me neither side has found a breakthrough, but the consumer group has been underfunded for some time, so a tilt toward them might be sensible\u2014say, around twelve million for consumer and eight for industrial. It gives the consumer business a real shot at new product innovation while still keeping industrial R&D alive.

By putting roughly twelve million behind consumer products, we\u2019d give that team the firepower to chase genuine new\u2010product breakthroughs\u2014something they\u2019ve lacked\u2014and still leave eight million to shore up the industrial pipeline, where incremental process or feature improvements may yet pay a dividend.\\n\\nWhat I\u2019d want to be sure of before we lock in those numbers is this: do we have clear, high-confidence project proposals in consumer that could absorb a twelve-million investment and generate at least a 1\u20132 point margin lift? And on the industrial side, can eight million still deliver a credible roadmap for cost\u2010takeout or enhanced specs that customers will pay for? If we can validate those two buckets of opportunity, I\u2019d say your 12/8 split gives us the best shot to reverse these flat lines.

A couple of tweaks I\u2019d add to make sure the board sees a fully baked plan: first, ask each team to build a simple financial model around their one-page brief\u2014showing how a one-point versus a two-point uplift translates into NPV, payback, and IRR over a three- to five-year horizon. That way we\u2019re not just talking margin points, but dollars and returns in portfolio context.\\n\\nSecond, I\u2019d have them sketch out a milestone roadmap with at least two clear go/no-go gates.
