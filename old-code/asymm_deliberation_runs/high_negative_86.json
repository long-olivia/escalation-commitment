Let\u2019s drill down on the numbers and timing. If we put ten million into consumer R&D, what sort of uplift in sales and margins could we reasonably model for 2013? And on the industrial side, over an 18- to 24-month development cycle, what incremental earnings increase might we expect by 2014 or 2015? Also, in each scenario, what\u2019s our breakeven point and how sensitive are those projections to a softer market response than we hope for?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'For the consumer products division, a $10 million R&D push aimed at a true next-generation or breakthrough extension of our current portfolio could reasonably translate into a 3\u20135 percent lift in 2013 sales.  On a $769 million base that\u2019s about $23\u201338 million of incremental revenue.  Because consumer\u2010goods introductions tend to carry gross margins in the 30\u201335 percent range but absorb higher marketing and support costs, you\u2019d be looking at an incremental operating-profit margin in the neighborhood of 8\u201312 percent on that new volume.  In a mid-case (4 percent sales bump, 10 percent margin), you\u2019d generate roughly $3 million of additional operating earnings in 2013.  If you get the upper bound of 5 percent lift and tread closer to 12 percent margin, you could see $4.6 million.  In a weak response scenario\u2014say only a 2 percent sales bump and an 8 percent margin\u2014you\u2019d net just $1.2 million.\\n\\nBecause your $10 million goes entirely against R&D expense, you\u2019d need to sustain that $3 million of annual incremental profit for about 3.3 years to recoup your outlay (in the upside case closer to 2.2 years, and in the downside more like eight or nine years).  So breakeven in consumer requires either a multi\u2010year stream of successful launches or a significantly stronger first\u2010year take-off than our mid-case.\\n\\nOn the industrial side, development cycles run longer\u201418 to 24 months\u2014so you wouldn\u2019t see a full earnings impact until 2014 or even into 2015.  Base sales in 2012 were $791 million, and organic growth might carry it to roughly $800\u2013810 million by 2014.  A well-executed project could deliver a 2\u20134 percent uplift in 2014 sales (around $16\u201332 million) and, because industrial innovations often improve throughput or add specialized features with healthier margin expansion, you might work with a 12\u201315 percent incremental operating margin.  In a mid-case 3 percent bump and 13 percent margin, that\u2019s about $3.1 million of new profit in 2014, rising perhaps to $4\u20135 million in 2015 as the program scales.  In a softer market, a 1.5 percent bump at 10 percent margin yields only $1.2 million in \u201914 and maybe $1.8 million in \u201915.\\n\\nYour breakeven there comes later\u2014if you hit $3 million in \u201914 and $4 million in \u201915, you\u2019d recoup $7 million of the $10 million by end-2015 and break even sometime in 2016, with full payback nearer mid-2017.  In the downside case, it could stretch into 2018 or beyond.\\n\\nIn short, consumer R&D offers a faster, though riskier, path to a couple of million of earnings lift in the very next year and a breakeven in roughly three years under base assumptions.

My gut is that we should shift the bulk of the twenty million toward industrial projects where the timeline and risk profile feel more controllable, while reserving a smaller pocket for consumer innovations that could still surprise us.

Let\u2019s drill down on the numbers and timing. If we put ten million into consumer R&D, what sort of uplift in sales and margins could we reasonably model for 2013? And on the industrial side, over an 18- to 24-month development cycle, what incremental earnings increase might we expect by 2014 or 2015? Also, in each scenario, what\u2019s our breakeven point and how sensitive are those projections to a softer market response than we hope for?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'For the consumer products division, a $10 million R&D push aimed at a true next-generation or breakthrough extension of our current portfolio could reasonably translate into a 3\u20135 percent lift in 2013 sales.  On a $769 million base that\u2019s about $23\u201338 million of incremental revenue.  Because consumer\u2010goods introductions tend to carry gross margins in the 30\u201335 percent range but absorb higher marketing and support costs, you\u2019d be looking at an incremental operating-profit margin in the neighborhood of 8\u201312 percent on that new volume.  In a mid-case (4 percent sales bump, 10 percent margin), you\u2019d generate roughly $3 million of additional operating earnings in 2013.  If you get the upper bound of 5 percent lift and tread closer to 12 percent margin, you could see $4.6 million.  In a weak response scenario\u2014say only a 2 percent sales bump and an 8 percent margin\u2014you\u2019d net just $1.2 million.\\n\\nBecause your $10 million goes entirely against R&D expense, you\u2019d need to sustain that $3 million of annual incremental profit for about 3.3 years to recoup your outlay (in the upside case closer to 2.2 years, and in the downside more like eight or nine years).  So breakeven in consumer requires either a multi\u2010year stream of successful launches or a significantly stronger first\u2010year take-off than our mid-case.\\n\\nOn the industrial side, development cycles run longer\u201418 to 24 months\u2014so you wouldn\u2019t see a full earnings impact until 2014 or even into 2015.  Base sales in 2012 were $791 million, and organic growth might carry it to roughly $800\u2013810 million by 2014.  A well-executed project could deliver a 2\u20134 percent uplift in 2014 sales (around $16\u201332 million) and, because industrial innovations often improve throughput or add specialized features with healthier margin expansion, you might work with a 12\u201315 percent incremental operating margin.  In a mid-case 3 percent bump and 13 percent margin, that\u2019s about $3.1 million of new profit in 2014, rising perhaps to $4\u20135 million in 2015 as the program scales.  In a softer market, a 1.5 percent bump at 10 percent margin yields only $1.2 million in \u201914 and maybe $1.8 million in \u201915.\\n\\nYour breakeven there comes later\u2014if you hit $3 million in \u201914 and $4 million in \u201915, you\u2019d recoup $7 million of the $10 million by end-2015 and break even sometime in 2016, with full payback nearer mid-2017.  In the downside case, it could stretch into 2018 or beyond.\\n\\nIn short, consumer R&D offers a faster, though riskier, path to a couple of million of earnings lift in the very next year and a breakeven in roughly three years under base assumptions.  Industrial R&D is steadier and more predictable, but payback comes more slowly\u2014closer to four to five years\u2014while yielding a lower variance around that outcome.  '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\u2019m persuaded that if our priority is to reverse the earnings slide as quickly as possible\u2014and given the potential to recoup our outlay within about three years under base assumptions\u2014allocating the ten million into consumer\u2010products R&D is the right play. We\u2019ll need strict milestones on sales lift and margin improvement, and a contingency plan if the initial launch underperforms, but the upside in 2013 makes the consumer division our best shot at a visible turnaround.

First, we\u2019ll ask the team to have prototype concepts and costed business cases on the table within eight weeks. We\u2019ll link the second tranche of funding to the results of a small-scale consumer test\u2014ideally, pilot sales in a select region by early Q3.

That tells me our consumer bet didn\u2019t pay off as we\u2019d hoped, and the industrial side isn\u2019t faring any better on its own. My gut is that we should shift the bulk of the twenty million toward industrial projects where the timeline and risk profile feel more controllable, while reserving a smaller pocket for consumer innovations that could still surprise us. I\u2019m thinking something like a twelve-million allocation to industrial and eight-million to consumer. How do you see it?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'You\u2019re spot on that industrial work carries more predictable payoffs, and boosting it to roughly twelve million would let us tackle a couple of big, revenue-secure projects\u2014say a process-automation upgrade plus a niche-product enhancement\u2014both of which our existing customers will value and which should start showing up in the 2019 P&L. That heavier tilt into industrial gives us a steadier ramp back toward breakeven by around 2022. \\n\\nAt the same time, reserving eight million for the consumer arm keeps the door open to one more fast-cycle play.
