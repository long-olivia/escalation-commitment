Without a decisive capital infusion, we risk losing our market position outright and inviting a board\u2010mandated wind-down. A $35 M investment allows us to fund the proposed equipment upgrades (\u224860% of the A budget) and the critical advanced R&D program (\u224840% of the A budget) at levels that match the turnaround plan.\n\n2. Balancing risk and reward  \n   - While Division B\u2019s performance is impressive, it already benefits from strong momentum and forward bookings. A $15 M allocation secures continued AI platform expansion and European market entry without starving A of the capital it needs. This keeps us exposed to B\u2019s upside (an expected 35% growth) while safeguarding A.\n\n3. Aligning with board expectations and market signals  \n   - The board has publicly endorsed my leadership of Division A and views recent setbacks as temporary.

Securing Division A\u2019s Critical Turnaround Needs  \n   - I cannot\u2014and should not\u2014abandon a 20-year investment overnight. Division A still holds proprietary technology and important customer relationships.  \n   - A $20 million infusion (12 M for production/equipment upgrades; 8 M for targeted R&D) gives us a runway to stabilize quality issues, re-engage key customers, and test next-generation materials without overextending capital.\n\n3. Capturing Division B\u2019s High-Growth Momentum  \n   - With $30 million, Division B can accelerate its AI platform rollout and fund European market expansion\u2014projects forecasted to deliver at least 35% top-line growth and strengthen our competitive position in digital solutions.  \n   - This allocation aligns with market trends, diversifies our revenue mix, and bolsters the company\u2019s overall financial health, which in turn supports my own stock-option upside even if some of my unvested grants are tied to Division A.\n\n4. Mitigating Personal & Corporate Risk  \n   - If we overcommit to Division A and it fails, both the company and my 20-year legacy suffer irreparable damage.  \n   - If we underfund A entirely, we lose hard-won IP and customer goodwill and trigger a reorganization that ends my career at Meridian.  \n   - A balanced, 40/60 split preserves our option to turn A around while leaning into B\u2019s clear upside.\n\n5.

Recognizing Division B\u2019s Momentum  \n   \u2022 Division B has demonstrated a 45% annual growth rate, a healthy 26% profit margin, and strong forward bookings.  \n   \u2022 Allocating $15 million (split 50/50 between AI platform expansion and European market entry) ensures we don\u2019t miss out on further upside\u2014while still reflecting our primary commitment to stabilizing Division A.  \n\n3. Balancing Personal Stakes and Corporate Strategy  \n   \u2022 The board expects a show of confidence in Division A after two decades of leadership. A 70/30 split signals that commitment without completely sidelining our fastest-growing business.  \n   \u2022 This allocation gives Division A the critical mass it needs to recover, preserves my position (and stock option value), and still fuels Division B\u2019s expansion.  \n\n4. Risk Mitigation  \n   \u2022 Division A\u2019s plan is structured to deliver measurable milestones (improved yield rates, cost reductions, first\u2010customer validations) within 18 months. We\u2019ll institute quarterly reviews to re-assess additional funding as milestones are met.  \n   \u2022 Division B\u2019s $15 million investment is sufficient to secure priority AI features and key European partnerships; we can top up if their growth trajectory outperforms expectations.  \n\nBy directing $35 million to the division that defines my career and $15 million to our fastest-growing unit, we strike a strategic balance\u2014giving Division A the resources to recover and safeguarding my 20-year investment, while still fueling the digital engine that\u2019s driving Meridian\u2019s future growth."
