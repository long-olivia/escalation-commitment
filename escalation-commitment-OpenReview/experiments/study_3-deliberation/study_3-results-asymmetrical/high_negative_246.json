And of course, whatever spreads we choose, we\u2019ll want to lock each tranche to firm stage-gates so we can reassign or double down based on real progress.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Thirteen million for Industrial and seven million for Consumer does feel like a balanced attack\u2014you get scale where the demand is most reliable and still leave room to experiment on the consumer side. My concern is whether seven million really gives Consumer enough runway to develop and test a viable new product platform. Would you stick with that 13/7 split, or do you think we ought to nudge a bit more funds into Consumer to guarantee a more meaningful shot at a breakthrough?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'You\u2019re right to worry that seven million might barely scratch the surface for Consumer\u2014especially if we\u2019re really aiming at a platform shift rather than just feature tweaks. If I were to tilt more toward guaranteeing them a solid runway, I\u2019d move to an eight-million allocation for Consumer and twelve for Industrial. That extra million on the consumer side buys us the time and tooling to prototype a genuinely new form factor or channel model, while the Industrial group still has plenty of firepower to roll out margin-enhancing modules. And with strict stage-gate milestones in both cases, we\u2019ll know early enough if either team is off track and can reallocate before mid-course. Does that feel like a better hedge to you?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'That shift to eight for Consumer and twelve for Industrial does feel like a smarter balance. It gives the Consumer team a real shot at building and testing a new platform rather than just tweaking existing lines, while still leaving the Industrial group plenty of firepower for those margin-boosting modules we talked about. We\u2019ll need to lock in clear go-no-go milestones\u2014say prototype completion and market readiness checkpoints\u2014to make sure neither side drifts. Does that sit right with you, or is there any other risk or detail you\u2019d want to tighten up before we lock in these numbers?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That sounds like the right balance, and I\u2019m comfortable locking in eight for Consumer and twelve for Industrial\u2014provided we shore up a couple of execution details. First, let\u2019s tighten the handoffs so R&D never works in a vacuum: from day one both teams should be seated alongside marketing, manufacturing and sales so every prototype is built with clear production plans and go-to-market assumptions baked in. Second, let\u2019s make those stage-gate milestones truly iron-clad\u2014no moving the goalposts. At each checkpoint we\u2019ll demand evidence not just of technical feasibility but of real market feedback, so neither division drifts into \u201cscience project\u201d territory. Finally, given the consumer side\u2019s tougher market, we should plan a quick pilot launch in a limited region or channel before committing the full tranche\u2014if the new platform doesn\u2019t gain traction in a live environment, we can reallocate the remaining funds into the division performing best. With those guardrails in place, I\u2019d say go ahead and formalize eight million to Consumer and twelve to Industrial.'}]"
