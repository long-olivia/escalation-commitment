The March market test also neatly lines up with early-fiscal-year rollouts. \\n\\nIf I were to tweak anything, I\u2019d consider two small refinements. First, reduce the initial tranche slightly to 3 million; that way we minimize sunk costs if the concept doesn\u2019t pan out, then pull forward an extra million into the final tranche when we hit firm production specs. Second, shift the pilot-line milestone back by one month\u2014into January\u2014so we aren\u2019t squeezing holiday shutdowns or year-end audits.

Pushing more into Consumer lets us back a bigger effort to find that one new product or reformulation that could finally arrest the slide in earnings.\\n\\nMy only caveat is that we build in fast-failure checkpoints. If by mid-2018 the Consumer projects aren\u2019t showing proof of concept\u2014the early trials or pilot runs don\u2019t point toward at least a break-even case\u2014then we need the agility to reallocate whatever remains into the industrial side, where the smaller, more predictable wins are. Otherwise I\u2019m comfortable with your twelve/eight split as a way to balance breakthrough risk in Consumer against steady improvement in Industrial.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I agree, building in those fast-failure checkpoints is critical. We could earmark the twelve million for Consumer in three tranches of four each, tied to specific go/no-go milestones\u2014say concept validation by September 2018, pilot-line performance by December, and market test results by March. If any tranche doesn\u2019t hit its metrics, we pull the remaining dollars back into Industrial. Do you think those timing milestones make sense, or would you adjust the schedule or tranche sizes?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That three-tranche approach is exactly the right philosophy\u2014forcing go/no-go gates and preserving optionality. The September concept validation is spot on for giving us enough runway to flesh out formulations, and a December pilot-line milestone keeps the development cadence tight. The March market test also neatly lines up with early-fiscal-year rollouts. \\n\\nIf I were to tweak anything, I\u2019d consider two small refinements. First, reduce the initial tranche slightly to 3 million; that way we minimize sunk costs if the concept doesn\u2019t pan out, then pull forward an extra million into the final tranche when we hit firm production specs. Second, shift the pilot-line milestone back by one month\u2014into January\u2014so we aren\u2019t squeezing holiday shutdowns or year-end audits. That would push the market-test tranche into April, which actually gives us a bit more real-world selling season before we measure consumer response.  \\n\\nBut frankly, your September/December/March framework with equal tranches is very defensible. Those minor tweaks just buy a little extra breathing room around critical handoffs. Let me know if you\u2019d prefer we lock in exactly the three 4-million tranches as is or apply those small adjustments.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Your refinements are smart\u2014they shave down initial exposure and give us breathing room around the holidays. I\u2019m inclined to go with a 3\u20134\u20135 split, pushing the pilot-line gate into January and the market test into April as you suggested. But if you think the equal 4\u20134\u20134 approach keeps us more disciplined and simpler to track, I\u2019m open to that too. Which structure would you back\u2014your trimmed tranches with shifted dates, or the straight three equal installments?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I\u2019d stick with the trimmed 3\u20134\u20135 split and the shifted dates. Cutting the first tranche to three million means we\u2019re only minimally exposed until we see proof that the concept has real technical promise, and the holiday buffer around our pilot\u2010line gate will keep year-end distractions from derailing that work. Then by the time we move into the larger five-million market test in April, we\u2019ll have really solid early indicators and some post-holiday selling momentum behind us. \\n\\nYes, it\u2019s a touch more complexity than straight 4\u20134\u20134, but with clear milestone charters and disciplined reporting, I think we\u2019ll actually avoid false starts and midstream dead ends better than if we blindly equalize each tranche. All told, the smaller up-front commitment plus the timing tweak gives us the best balance of risk control and runway for a true consumer breakthrough.'}]"
