My gut says we ought to hedge our bets rather than pour the entire twenty million into a single division, but I want to hear your gut: with both divisions stuck in similar red ink, do you feel either one has the processes or pipelines in place to turn a fresh R&D infusion into profit faster than the other?  \\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer  \\nHonestly, neither division has meaningfully righted the ship. Consumer R&D still moves quickly but seems to be spinning its wheels on incremental features with little market pull. Industrial R&D remains constrained by long validation cycles. Both need some work, but in very different ways.  \\n\\nThat makes sense. If consumer has the sprint mentality but is out of ideas, and industrial has ideas but is blocked by process, perhaps the way forward is to split the funding and condition it on each division fixing its key bottleneck. If we tilt too heavily one way, we risk stifling the other. What split between the two feels like the right balance of giving each enough fuel to revamp its R&D engine but still demanding accountability for quicker results?  \\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer  \\nI\u2019d lean toward giving industrial the lion\u2019s share\u2014say a bit over half\u2014so they can invest in faster validation tools and customer pilots, but still hold back enough for consumer to pick out two or three bold projects and push them to market. That way we address the serious process drag in industrial, but don\u2019t abandon the consumer group\u2019s agility.  \\n\\nI agree. Let\u2019s allocate twelve million to the industrial division, earmarked for process modernization, rapid-prototype labs, and pilot engagements, and the remaining eight million to the consumer division with a mandate to run two high-impact pilots under a compressed timeline. That split should give us the best chance at breaking the logjam in industrial and still capturing one or two consumer product wins this year.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That sounds like a solid approach.
