To spread our chances of a turnaround, I\u2019m inclined to split the $20 million evenly between consumer and industrial R&D. What do you think?  \\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer  \\nSplitting evenly hedges our bets, but it risks underfunding whichever division actually has a better chance to rebound. Given the identical numbers, we might actually learn more by shifting more of the spend to the division whose market dynamics have longer horizons\u2014industrial\u2014while still keeping something aside for consumer.  \\n\\nThat\u2019s a good point. Consumer already got our big push and didn\u2019t improve, so maybe putting more into industrial could reveal untapped opportunities there. If we lean in that direction, what split would you recommend?  \\n\\nAssistant Financial Officer  \\nI\u2019d suggest allocating roughly sixty percent to industrial and forty percent to consumer. That gives industrial about $12 million to pursue deeper, longer-cycle projects where we\u2019ve seen persistent margin erosion, and leaves $8 million to address quick-hit innovation in consumer markets so we don\u2019t abandon any chance of a faster payoff there.  \\n\\nI see the sense in that. A 12/8 split lets us test a fresh industrial push while still nurturing consumer initiatives that can move quickly. Let\u2019s go with $12 million for Industrial Products R&D and $8 million for Consumer Products R&D. That way we balance our need to explore longer-term breakthroughs with the option for seasonal consumer gains.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Understood. I\u2019ll move forward with allocating twelve million to the Industrial Products division and eight million to Consumer Products. I\u2019ll notify both division heads today, and we\u2019ll set up kickoff sessions early next week to define project scopes, key milestones and success metrics. For Industrial, we\u2019ll focus on the longer-term technology breakthroughs that can rebuild our margin profile, while in Consumer we\u2019ll concentrate on a pipeline of seasonal innovations designed to boost volume and brand buzz.
