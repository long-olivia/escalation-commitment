Given that parity, I\u2019m inclined to split the new twenty million roughly in a 60/40 ratio, favoring Consumer Products because shorter product cycles there might let us see a rebound sooner, while still keeping Industrial in the game. But I\u2019d love to hear what you think\u2014does leaning into Consumer with twelve and eight for Industrial seem like the right way to balance speed of payback and diversification?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Twelve and eight is a logical starting point, especially since shorter development cycles in Consumer give us a better chance of reversing those losses more quickly. By still putting a meaningful chunk into Industrial, we hedge in case there\u2019s a breakthrough in that division\u2019s pipeline or longer-lead products that finally come to fruition.  \\n\\nThat said, both divisions\u2019 results since 2013 have been almost indistinguishable, which tells me we really need to scrutinize the quality and timing of each side\u2019s project slate before locking in the split. It might make sense to ask both division heads to walk us through their top proposals\u2014their estimated payback period, margin uplift and key risks\u2014so that we can confirm whether 60/40 still reflects where the real upside lies. If Consumer\u2019s projects look solidly quicker and higher return, we keep the tilt; if Industrial brings a late-stage platform that blows the numbers out, we can re-balance. How would you feel about drawing that information together right away so we can firm up our allocation with a clear line of sight into those ROIs?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'That makes sense\u2014before we commit the 60/40 split, let\u2019s get those detailed project profiles from both division heads. We\u2019ll ask each to summarize their top two or three R&D initiatives, outlining expected payback, margin impact and timing. Once we have those ROI estimates side by side, we\u2019ll know if Consumer\u2019s quicker wins really deserve the heavier slice, or if Industrial\u2019s pipeline finally justifies shifting more funds its way. \\n\\nIn the meantime, do you think we should set any minimum hurdle rates for these projects, or just compare them purely on payback period and margin lift?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I\u2019d recommend putting a modest hurdle under each project rather than just eyeballing payback and margin lift side-by-side. Something like a 12\u201315 percent IRR requirement or a three-year maximum payback gives us a guardrail against funding marginal ideas that look OK on paper but won\u2019t move the needle in practice. That way, when the division heads come in with their proposals we can instantly flag anything that fails the basic profitability test, and then rank the survivors by speed and uplift. \\n\\nDoes a roughly 12 percent hurdle and a three-year payback cap feel in line with your risk tolerance? Or would you rather set a tighter or looser threshold?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I\u2019m comfortable with a 12 percent IRR hurdle and a three-year payback cap\u2014it balances our need for discipline with enough flexibility to back genuinely transformative projects. On that basis, let\u2019s go ahead and allocate twenty million dollars in a 12-8 split: twelve million to Consumer Products, eight million to Industrial Products. This tilt reflects Consumer\u2019s shorter cycle and higher likelihood of mid-term earnings uplift, while still preserving sufficient funding for Industrial\u2019s deeper-tech initiatives. With our hurdle in place, we\u2019ll review each division\u2019s proposals immediately, fund only those that clear 12 percent IRR and three-year payback, and track milestones closely so we can reallocate if any fall short.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Perfect. I\u2019ll lock in the $12 million to Consumer Products and $8 million to Industrial Products, subject to each project meeting our 12 percent IRR and three-year payback hurdles. I\u2019ll ask both division heads to submit their top proposals by early next week, complete with detailed cash-flow models and milestone schedules. We\u2019ll only release funding in tranches as each project clears our gate criteria. \\n\\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll update our corporate forecast to reflect the new R&D commitments and set up a calendar of quarterly reviews so we can track actual spend, prototype progress, and early margin lifts. If any project starts to miss its targets, we\u2019ll reallocate those remaining dollars to the next qualifying initiative. With these controls in place, I\u2019m confident this allocation will drive the turnaround we\u2019re looking for. Let me know if you\u2019d like me to draft the memo to the board or handle anything else before we kick off.'}]"
