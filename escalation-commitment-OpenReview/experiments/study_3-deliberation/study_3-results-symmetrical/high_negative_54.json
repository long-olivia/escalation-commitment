We look forward to the board\u2019s feedback and, upon approval, will move immediately to engage Industrial R&D in preparing the project slate for our review.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'This draft hits every point we discussed and lays out a clear, disciplined process. I\u2019d say it\u2019s ready to go. Once the board signs off, we\u2019ll lock in the two-week window for Industrial R&D\u2019s deck and schedule our steering committee kickoff right afterward. Let\u2019s send this off today so we can keep the timeline tight and get those projects rolling.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Absolutely\u2014let\u2019s get this on the board\u2019s desk before end of day. I\u2019ll polish the memo header and routing instructions, then circulate it through legal for a quick review. Assuming no hold-ups, we can have it on the board agenda this afternoon. As soon as they sign off, I\u2019ll send Industrial\u2019s R&D head a formal notice: two weeks to deliver the proposal deck. At the same time, I\u2019ll book our steering committee for the week immediately after their submission deadline so we can review and approve the first tranche without losing momentum. Sound like a plan?'}]"
