Here\u2019s the revised memo:\\n\\nTo: R&D Steering Committee and Industrial Products Division Leadership  \\nFrom: Finance Department  \\nDate: [Today\u2019s Date]  \\nSubject: Allocation of $10 Million in R&D Funding to Industrial Products Division  \\n\\nFollowing our review of the corporation\u2019s recent performance and competitive positioning, we are directing the $10 million of additional R&D funding to the Industrial Products division. Over the past decade, this division has demonstrated the most reliable sales growth trajectory\u2014rising from $670 million in 2002 to $791 million in 2012\u2014despite margin pressures. This trend underscores robust market demand and provides the best opportunity to translate R&D investment into near-term earnings improvement.\\n\\nTo ensure accountability and clear lines of sight on results, all project proposals submitted for this funding must include:  \\n\u2022 A specific performance metric and target date (for example, a 5 percent reduction in per-unit process cost by Q3 2013 or the delivery of two prototype product extensions by December 31, 2012)  \\n\u2022 A defined ROI hurdle of 15\u201320 percent over an 18-month horizon  \\n\u2022 A one-page milestone chart detailing quarterly targets, key risks, and go/no-go decision points  \\n\\nProgress updates will be due on the last business day of each quarter, aligning with our financial close calendar. The Steering Committee will review and prioritize proposals based on these criteria, and quarterly reviews will track adherence to milestones and ROI gates.\\n\\nWe will hold a kickoff meeting on Friday, October 12, to finalize project scopes and begin work immediately. Our goal is to generate measurable efficiency gains or new revenue streams within the next fiscal cycle, thereby restoring division profitability and contributing meaningfully to corporate earnings.\\n\\nThank you for your prompt attention. Please circulate this memo to all relevant teams and prepare your proposals for the first review session.  \\n\\nLet me know if you\u2019d like any further tweaks before we issue it.'}]"
