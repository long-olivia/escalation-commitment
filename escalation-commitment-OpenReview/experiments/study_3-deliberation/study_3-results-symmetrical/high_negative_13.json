I\u2019ll reach out to Finance immediately so they have the fund\u2010release framework ready, and I\u2019ll send out the invite for tomorrow morning\u2019s kick-off. Let\u2019s target 9:30 so everyone has time to review your one-pager in advance. Once we\u2019ve got our project manager in place on that call, we\u2019ll hand off your charter and officially open the feasibility phase. With Product, Legal, Marketing and Retail Partnerships all aligned around those four deliverables, we\u2019ll be well on our way to hitting our week-eight gates. Looking forward to getting started and driving Consumer Products back to profitable growth.'}]"
