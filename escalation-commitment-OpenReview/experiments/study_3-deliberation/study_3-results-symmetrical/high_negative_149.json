We\u2019ll allocate the full $10 million to the Consumer Products Division with the eight-week stage-gate structure and monthly progress check-ins. We\u2019ll define Gate 1 metrics around prototype performance\u2014connectivity reliability, battery life, UI satisfaction above our target NPS\u2014and initial user-test engagement. Gate 2 will hinge on a larger cohort\u2019s feedback plus measurable pre-order or channel interest. If either gate falls short, we immediately halt any remaining consumer spend and redirect it into industrial process enhancements. With this disciplined approach, we capture the consumer division\u2019s upside while keeping downside firmly contained.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'That sounds like a solid plan. Today I\u2019ll work with the consumer\u2010division R&D leaders to finalize the product specifications and testing protocols, lock in those NPS and technical benchmarks for Gate 1, and set up the calendar invites for our eight-week reviews and monthly check-ins. I\u2019ll also inform the industrial\u2010division team of the contingency so they\u2019re ready to stand up process\u2010improvement projects if we need to pivot. With everyone clear on the milestones and the rapid\u2010response funding switch, we\u2019ll have both the fuel and the guardrails to drive a consumer breakthrough while protecting the company\u2019s overall performance.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Perfect. I\u2019ll get the first tranche released to the consumer\u2010division R&D team today and coordinate with finance to set up the tranche releases tied to those stage\u2010gate milestones. I\u2019ll also send out calendar invites for our eight-week reviews and monthly check-ins so everyone\u2019s aligned. Let me know as soon as the product specs and test protocols are locked down, and I\u2019ll work with you to finalize the targets for Gate 1. With that in place, we\u2019ll be ready to move fast and shift resources if needed. Good to have this wrapped up\u2014let\u2019s make sure we hit those early milestones.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Great\u2014I\u2019ll have the detailed product specs and test\u2010protocol document on your desk by this afternoon, with our proposed connectivity, battery and UI NPS targets for Gate 1. I\u2019ll also send over the draft milestone calendar so you can confirm the dates before I issue those calendar invites. Once you approve, we\u2019ll release tranche one and kick off the first user\u2010test cycle. Thanks for moving swiftly here\u2014this sets us up perfectly to hit that eight\u2010week mark with clarity and speed.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'That works perfectly. Once I\u2019ve reviewed the specs and the draft calendar, I\u2019ll sign off on Gate 1\u2019s targets and release tranche one immediately. Let\u2019s tentatively set our Gate 1 review for eight weeks from today, Gate 2 for sixteen weeks out, with brief monthly check-ins in between. Send me the document and calendar draft as soon as they\u2019re ready, and I\u2019ll confirm by this afternoon so we can get those funds flowing and user testing underway without delay.'}]"
