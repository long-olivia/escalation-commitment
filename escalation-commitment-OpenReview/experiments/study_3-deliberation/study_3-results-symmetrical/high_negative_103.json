By funding two or three precisely scoped projects tied to clear cost and technical milestones, embedding an early customer-validation checkpoint, and holding a 5\u201310% reserve to rapidly back any breakout winner, we ensure a disciplined, market-driven R&D process that can quickly convert top-line momentum into meaningful margin improvement.\"}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Perfect. We\u2019ll commit all ten million to the Consumer Products division under our agreed framework: pick two or three high-potential concepts, define cost and technical milestones for each, build in that early customer-validation checkpoint, and set aside five to ten percent as a rapid follow-on fund for any breakout winner. I\u2019ll pull together the kickoff materials this afternoon\u2014drafting the agenda, lining up division leadership alongside marketing, supply-chain and our key customer panel, and scheduling our phase-gate review calendar. Once we\u2019ve signed off on the concepts, milestones and contingency rules, we\u2019ll have full visibility on performance and the flexibility to reallocate in real time if a project starts to falter or exceeds expectations. With that discipline in place, I\u2019m confident Consumer Products will turn its top-line momentum into real, sustainable margin uplift. Let\u2019s get it on the books and notify the team so we can hit the ground running.'}]"
